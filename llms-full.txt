## Why do 40% to 50% of students not finish their doctoral degree?

A study conducted by the University of Delaware found that proposal approval rates average only

20–33%. And the longer your proposal is not approved, the higher the chance that you will not finish.

# Welcome to Dissertation Prep

- ## Dear Doctoral Candidates,

According to David Litalien, an education researcher who conducted a study on doctoral dropout rates, “doctoral dropout rates are high in North America: an estimated **40% to 50% of candidates never finish**. Though these rates have been relatively stable over time.” We want to move you from candidate to completion - from ABD to Doctor!

### You Don't Have To Struggle By Yourself

### Professionals Who Are Always There For You

### Your Dissertation Will Get Finished Quicker

- ### **WHY DO 40% TO 50% OF STUDENTS NOT FINISH THEIR DOCTORAL DEGREE?**

A study conducted by the University of Delaware found that proposal approval rates average at maximum, 33%. The longer your study is not approved, the higher the chance that you will not finish. The top reasons doctoral students report dropping out are:

• Lacking of mentoring and support

• Feelings of aimlessness and exhaustion

• Lack of community

• Poor relationships with supervisors

• The professional and psychological consequences of remaining in ABD status

From our experience, most students who have an approved proposal can be successful and are more likely to graduate, which is why we have created consulting and editing options, as well as Programs to help you regardless of where you are in your studies.

The reason why nearly half of doctoral students do not graduate? Plain and simple. The dissertation. What’s arguably the largest milestone in the dissertation?  The Dissertation Proposal. The second big hurdle? Data collection and finalizing your results.

Our experience tells us that the problem doesn’t necessarily have to do with you.

It’s often the structure of the doctoral education system. It's often underfunding. It's often the structure of the organization.

If you made it to the dissertation stage, you likely have the intellect and perseverance necessary to earn a doctoral degree.

We have been coaching dissertation students for over 50 years collectively, mostly students who are mentally blocked, exhausted, stalled, or in need of some practical guidance - someone who can see the forest for the trees and doesn't have analysis paralysis. (Yes, that's a real thing!)

We have many programs or hourly options to get you quick help from a friendly, doctorally-qualified Research Coach who currently works with doctoral learners in the United States as a research mentor to help you:

Refine your research topic to be laser-sharp and well-justified  Plan a clear, logical structure that tells an engaging story from the gap in literature

Write up a well-polished proposal that earns a “yes” from your committee!

Help you as you work through IRB and begin to collect data.

Assist as you write up your data analysis and conclusions.

Prepare you for your oral defense!

As you browse through the rest of the site, we’ll share with you exactly how we help you accomplish your goals of completing your doctoral degree. Finally - moving from Candidate to Completion!

Sincerely,

Dr. Dani Babb

Date: 2025-12-09
Description: Transform your PhD literature review from aimless summaries to a strategic direction. Learn 4 proven strategies to identify your research gap and build a purposeful dissertation argument.

_By Nicole Dhanraj, Ph.D._

## Understanding the Pitfall: Synthesis vs. Purpose

You may recall from our previous conversation, Stop Writing a Book Report, Start
Synthesizing Your Literature Review, that many doctoral students summarize articles
instead of synthesizing them. That leads to those lengthy, disjointed summaries we
know frustrate every dissertation chair.

But now, let's explore why even a well-synthesized literature review can still miss the
mark: it lacks a clear, driving purpose.

If your writing doesn't clearly map out a destination, that is, your unique contribution, it
won't matter how polished the sentences are; you'll simply be drifting.

## The Mentor's Insight: Moving Beyond Summary

I've seen this pattern countless times. The process begins with good intentions: you
open your laptop, review your stacks of PDFs, and start writing foundational statements:

"Researchers have studied leadership styles for decades…"

You keep writing, driven by the need to cover the existing literature.

Twenty pages later, you pause and realize you've produced a vast amount of material,
but unfortunately, you haven't yet made a clear argument.

This is the moment your chair and me, your editor, often intervene with those crucial,
clarifying questions:

"What is the purpose of this section?"

How does this connect to your research problem or, more importantly, the gap?”

The writing might be clear, the sources solid. But without an explicit “why”, the
justification for your specific study, your review becomes a beautiful scenic drive with no
actual arrival point.

The mentor's wisdom here is simple: The ultimate "why" of your literature review is to
identify and justify the specific research gap your study will fill.

If it isn't doing that, it remains just an impressive collection of knowledge. I know, great
work but no impact from your writing!

## The Fix: Writing Strategically with Direction

The good news is that moving forward doesn't require scrapping everything; it requires
reframing your existing content.

You need to organize the literature around a central, unwavering storyline: the necessity
of your research.

Writing with a why is the final step that elevates synthesis because you are no longer
just grouping ideas; you are strategically arranging the literature to build your unique,
evidence-based argument.

Here are four strategies to immediately give your review direction:

1. _Anchor Everything to Your Research Question_

Before you draft another paragraph, I encourage you to print your research question
    and tape it above your desk…multiple places on your desk!

Every single section must help answer it by establishing what is currently known and
    identifying the critical piece that is missing.

For example:

If your dissertation explores burnout and nurse retention, structure your analysis like
    this:

“While prior studies confirm that burnout contributes to turnover, few have examined
    how organizational culture moderates that relationship, an essential area this study is
    designed to investigate rigorously.”

Notice the shift? Your writing is now **intentional and directional.**

2. _Create a Strategic Reader Roadmap_

A clear roadmap is a gift to your committee; it shows them you are writing with strategy.
    Place this directional statement at the beginning of your chapter.

Here is a roadmap example:

“This review begins by establishing the known link between burnout and turnover,
    before transitioning to an exploration of the lesser-examined organizational culture
    factors (specifically leadership support), and concludes by synthesizing studies that
    reveal the exact gap this dissertation addresses: the moderating role of leadership
    support in high-stress clinical units.”

3. _Tie Every Section Back to the Gap_

Conclude each major section or subsection by explicitly connecting the studied
    knowledge to the knowledge that remains uncaptured.

This reinforces the necessity of your study every few pages. You want to be clear that
    there is a gap and your study will bridge that gap.

For example:

“Taken together, these studies illustrate the strong link between burnout and turnover,
    yet they rarely consider how positive leadership behaviors buffer this effect, a critical
    gap addressed directly in this study’s methodology.”

4. _Use Purposeful Language_

Your transitions are the navigation tools. Move past generic phrases and use
    purposeful, argumentative language that guides your reader and please, don’t keep
    repeating the same transitions over and over.

“Building upon prior findings, we next explore…”

“Despite extensive research into X, a critical element remains unexamined: Y…”
    “However, few studies have been designed to examine the relationship between A and
    B…”

These phrases signal to your reviewer that you are thoughtfully moving them toward
    your unique contribution.

## The Payoff: Clarity and Authority

When you write with a clear “why,” the entire dissertation begins to snap into place.

Your introduction flows logically into your review, your review organically sets up your
methodology, and your methodology provides a clear path to answer your question.

You will have transformed a collection of articles into the logical, persuasive argument
that justifies the existence of your entire study.

## Ready to Transform Your Literature Review?

If your current chapter feels aimless, please know that you are in good company, and
you don't have to figure out this pivot alone. You don't need to rewrite; you need to
refocus and anchor your argument to your research gap.

Let's stop wasting time and start building the foundation of your dissertation right now.

As a dissertation mentor and editor, I can help you clarify your “why,” organize your
structure, and transform your review into a purposeful and persuasive chapter that
seamlessly transitions into your research design.

it deserves, rather than wasting time and money.

Description: Stop summarizing studies like a book report. Learn how to synthesize your literature review with confidence and finally satisfy your dissertation committee.

_By Nicole Dhanraj, Ph.D._

“Your Literature Review Needs to Be Rewritten.”

Those five words can break your spirit.

You’ve spent late nights surrounded by journal articles, the smell of stale coffee and printer ink filling the room, highlighting until the ink fades, only to see your chair’s feedback: “Too descriptive.” “Needs more synthesis.” “Rewrite this section.”

You don’t know what else to do. Other than cry and curse perhaps. You’ve read everything. You’ve summarized every study. You’ve followed the examples in the writing guides. So why isn’t it enough?

Let me reassure you: you’re not failing. You are simply applying the wrong tool for the job. You’ve mastered summary, but your committee is grading you on synthesis.

Once you learn the difference, you’ll never approach your dissertation the same way again.

## The Problem: You’re Summarizing, Not Synthesizing

Summarizing is telling your reader what each study found. Synthesizing is showing how the studies connect, where they conflict, and what those relationships reveal.

Think of it this way: a summary is a stack of bricks. A synthesis is a finely woven tapestry, showing how all those individual parts connect to form a cohesive pattern.

When your literature review reads like a list of summaries, it might look “complete” on paper but to your committee, it feels disconnected and shallow. They’re looking for flow, logic, and critical insight, just not a series of article recaps, and this is what I often see.

A summary tells the story of other scholars. A synthesis tells the story of the field.

## The Fix: Synthesize Like a Scholar

Let’s talk about what synthesis actually looks like, step by step.

1. _Group by Idea, Not Author_

    Instead of giving each study its own paragraph, group them around shared ideas or patterns. For example, in a quantitative dissertation): “Across multiple studies, leadership support has been linked to improved job satisfaction (Adams, 2021; Roberts, 2023). However, when autonomy is low, this relationship weakens (Lee, 2020; Zhang, 2022), suggesting that supportive leadership only enhances satisfaction when employees also feel empowered.”

In a qualitative dissertation, it would look like; “Participants in several studies described a strong sense of belonging when leaders actively communicated (Smith, 2019; Carter, 2021). In contrast, those in remote teams without regular contact expressed feelings of invisibility, revealing a gap in how connection is sustained in virtual environments.”

Here, you’re showing readers how studies speak to each other, not just what each one said.

2. Compare, Contrast, and Explain

    After grouping, analyze how each study adds to (or complicates) the story. Ask yourself:

Where do researchers agree?

Where do they disagree?

What explains the differences?

These answers create intellectual tension and tension is what makes your review engaging.

Take for example: “While Smith (2020) found emotional intelligence predicted leadership effectiveness, Jones (2021) argued that organizational culture played a more significant role. This suggests that leadership success may rely as much on environment as individual skill; a nuance this dissertation explores.”

3. End Each Section With a “So What”

    Finish every section with a clear takeaway or gap statement. That’s what links your literature review to your research purpose. For example: “Taken together, these studies reveal a consistent recognition of burnout’s impact on employee retention but little exploration of how peer relationships buffer that effect. This gap frames the focus of the current study.”

These transitions turn your review into a cohesive narrative one that naturally leads to your research question. The payoff is more confidence and clarity with your literature review!

When you synthesize instead of summarize, everything clicks. Your literature review starts to read like you belong in the field. Your chair will see flow, argument, and purpose and not a patchwork of summaries.

And perhaps most importantly, you’ll finally understand why your literature review matters. It’s not just an assignment; it’s the intellectual foundation of your dissertation.text

## You’re Not Behind You’re Just at the Turning Point

If you’ve been told to “rewrite” your literature review, you don’t need to start from scratch. You need guidance to reshape what you already have into something structured, purposeful, and persuasive.

That’s where I come in. As a dissertation mentor and coach, I help students like you move from overwhelmed to clarity, turning red-ink feedback into strong, confident scholarship.

## Next Steps

This article is the first in a 7-part series on the most common literature review mistakes doctoral students make and how to fix them.

_By Nicole Dhanraj, Ph.D._

Does your dissertation feel like an insurmountable mountain? You’re not alone. Thousands of students face roadblocks during this journey, feeling stuck, overwhelmed, and unsure of their next step. But here’s the truth: with the right support and a clear plan, you can conquer your dissertation and confidently move toward your academic dreams.

This blog explores the lessons learned by those who’ve successfully defended their dissertations, why investing in a coach is worth it, and how to overcome concerns about cost.

## Why the Dissertation Journey Feels Overwhelming

The dissertation process is unlike any other academic milestone. It’s long, unpredictable, and often isolating. Breaking the project into smaller, manageable steps is crucial. By focusing on one section or task at a time, you’ll maintain momentum and make steady progress without becoming overwhelmed.

However, knowing where to start and how to organize your work can be a challenge in itself. A dissertation coach can help you develop a personalized plan, ensuring you stay on track and remain motivated throughout the journey.

## Lessons Learned from Dissertation Success Stories

1. Consistency Beats Perfection The most successful dissertation writers understand that progress, not perfection, is the goal. Some days will be more productive than others, but showing up and making an effort every day builds momentum over time.

2. Trust Yourself and the Process Uncertainty is a natural part of the dissertation journey. While doubt may creep in, trusting your abilities and the process itself is essential for moving forward.

3. Leverage Feedback Feedback is one of the most valuable tools for refining your dissertation. By integrating your research into coursework or seeking input early on, you’ll avoid significant revisions later and build confidence in your work.

4. Prioritize Balance The dissertation journey is demanding, but burnout doesn’t have to be part of the process. Taking breaks, finding moments of joy, and maintaining balance will keep you energized and focused.

## Addressing the Cost of a Dissertation Coach

It’s natural to have concerns about the cost of hiring a coach. After all, as a student, you may already feel stretched financially. But consider this: your dissertation is likely one of the most significant projects you’ll ever undertake, and investing in the right support can make all the difference in your success.

### The True Cost of Not Hiring a Coach

Without a coach, you may:

- Spend more time on your dissertation, delaying graduation and incurring additional tuition fees.
- Experience overwhelming stress that impacts your productivity and mental health.
- Risk submitting a subpar dissertation that requires extensive revisions or, worse, rejection.

In comparison, a coach helps you streamline the process, avoid costly mistakes, and finish faster, saving both time and money in the long run.

### Flexible Options to Fit Your Budget

Many dissertation coaches offer flexible packages to accommodate different budgets. Options might include:

- Hourly sessions for targeted guidance.
- Monthly coaching plans with ongoing support.
- Group coaching programs for a more affordable approach.

Coaching is an investment in your academic and professional future. The clarity, confidence, and efficiency you gain often outweigh the financial cost.

## How a Dissertation Coach Can Help You Succeed

While the dissertation process is inherently challenging, you don’t have to face it alone. A coach provides the structure, support, and expertise needed to turn an overwhelming project into a manageable and rewarding experience.

## Personalized Support for Your Unique Journey

Every dissertation is different. A coach tailors their approach to your needs, helping you overcome challenges, refine your work, and stay aligned with your goals.

## Accountability to Keep You on Track

Procrastination is a common hurdle during the dissertation process. A coach helps you set realistic deadlines and ensures you meet them, keeping you focused and productive.

## Expert Guidance to Navigate Obstacles

With years of experience, a coach can help you avoid common pitfalls and address challenges with confidence, saving you time and frustration.

## Emotional Encouragement When You Need It Most

The dissertation journey can feel isolating, but a coach provides ongoing encouragement and reassurance, helping you push through self-doubt and stay motivated.

## Take the First Step Toward Your Dissertation Success

Your dissertation is a journey, but it doesn’t have to be overwhelming or isolating. With personalized coaching, you’ll gain clarity, confidence, and the tools you need to succeed.

Embarking on the doctoral research journey as an English as a Second Language (ESL) Student is a testament to your dedication and hard work. It can be challenging, but the rewards are significant.

Your groundbreaking research and unique insights deserve to be communicated with clarity and impact.

Writing a dissertation in a second language presents significant hurdles, but [professional dissertation editing](https://dissertationprep.com/products/editing-and-apa-service) can be a game-changer in overcoming these obstacles and ensuring your work is polished and compelling. This guide will show you how.

## The Unique Challenges of ESL Doctoral Candidates: Navigating the Complexities of Academic Writing in a Second Language

As an ESL doctoral candidate, you face distinct challenges:

1. Reflecting on Your Journey. Prepare to discuss what you would do differently if given another chance. For example: “If I were to redo this study, I would expand the sample size to enhance the generalizability of the results. The initial sample was somewhat limited, and a larger cohort could provide more robust insights.”
2. Quantitative Research Insights: Be ready to justify your choice of statistical methods. For instance: “I chose multiple regression analysis because it allowed me to explore the relationship between various independent variables and the dependent variable simultaneously. This approach provided a comprehensive view of how these factors interact.”
3. Theoretical Framework and Methodology: Discuss how your theoretical framework supports your research. For example: “My theoretical framework integrates social constructivism and ecological systems theory. This combination was crucial for understanding how individual perceptions and environmental factors influence behavior, providing a holistic view of the research problem.”
4. Addressing Common Defense Questions:Be prepared for questions that test your grasp of your research’s significance and methodology. Here are specific examples:
1. How did you ensure the validity and reliability of your data?      - Example Answer: “To ensure validity, I used multiple data sources and cross-verified results. Reliability was addressed through consistent data collection procedures and periodic checks to maintain accuracy.”
2. What are the practical implications of your findings?      - Example Answer: “The practical implications include recommendations for policy changes in public health. For instance, my findings suggest implementing specific health interventions that could significantly improve community health outcomes.”
3. What major challenges did you encounter and how did you address them?      - Example Answer: “A major challenge was participant dropout. I tackled this by increasing follow-up efforts and adjusting my research timeline to accommodate potential losses, ensuring that my data remained robust.”
4. How does your study fit into or extend existing literature?      - Example Answer: “My study extends existing literature by applying a novel theoretical approach to explore new aspects of the topic, which provides fresh insights that challenge current assumptions.”

## The Intensity of Your Defense

The doctoral defense can be intense, and facing a panel of experts can feel overwhelming. Anticipating and preparing for challenging questions will be crucial to your success. This preparation includes understanding your research and being ready to articulate and defend your choices under scrutiny.

## The Unique Challenges of ESL Doctoral Candidates: Navigating the Complexities of Academic Writing in a Second Language

As an ESL doctoral candidate, you face distinct challenges:

1. Articulating Complex Ideas: Whether exploring quantum physics, historical sociopolitical theories, or advanced molecular biology in your dissertation, conveying intricate concepts with the precision required in English academic writing can be daunting. For instance, correctly using technical terminology in fields like biomedical research is crucial for accurately describing experimental procedures and results. Check out the Purdue OWL's guide for ESL writers for valuable writing tips.
2. Meeting Rigorous Academic Standards: Doctoral writing demands adherence to high academic and dissertation standards and field-specific conventions. In fields like law or engineering, meeting these standards requires precise adherence to terminology and formatting conventions that might differ significantly from your native language norms.
3. Maintaining Consistency: Ensuring a consistent tone and style throughout a dissertation is a significant task, particularly in a second language. For example, maintaining a consistent analytical voice and argumentation across a lengthy manuscript is essential for coherence in disciplines such as literature or philosophy.
4. Balancing Research and Writing: Juggling the demands of conducting research and clearly articulating your findings under tight deadlines can be overwhelming. In fields like social sciences or economics, where data analysis and theoretical framework integration are key, effective writing can be the linchpin of your dissertation's success.
5. Adapting to a New Academic Culture: The norms for critical analysis and overall writing style in English-language academia may differ significantly from those in your home country. For instance, in the field of business, there may be a stronger emphasis on data-driven conclusions and industry-specific jargon.

Choosing a [dissertation topic](https://dissertationprep.com/blogs/blog/dissertation-topic-selection-a-critical-choice-toward-doctoral-success-or-failure) can feel overwhelming—like navigating an endless maze. However, with the right strategies, you can turn this daunting doctoral task into an exciting opportunity for groundbreaking research. Here’s how to master the dissertation topic selection process and prepare for PhD success.

Here’s how to master the dissertation topic selection process and prepare for PhD success.

## Strategy 1: Conduct a Gap-Analysis Literature Review for Your Dissertation

A literature review helps you identify gaps in existing research that your dissertation can address. Here's how to leverage this strategy:

Step 1: Cast a Wide Net Start by searching academic databases like Google Scholar, JSTOR, or PsycINFO using broad terms related to your field. For example, if you're studying workplace stress, you might use terms like "occupational stress," "employee burnout," and "remote work well-being."

Step 2: Create a Literature Map Visualizing your findings helps you quickly spot under-researched areas. For instance, if you're studying workplace stress:

- Workplace Stress

  - Traditional Office Settings
    - Quantitative Studies: Survey-based research (80%)
    - Qualitative Studies: Interview-based research (20%)

- Remote Work Environments
  - Quantitative Studies
    - Limited data
    - Qualitative Studies
    - Very few studies

This map reveals that remote work environments are under-studied compared to traditional office settings.

Step 3: Use your map to pinpoint research gaps. For instance, you might discover that limited research exists on how remote work affects stress levels in tech industries versus healthcare settings. This gap is an opportunity for new research.

Step 4: Follow the recommendations within research papers, as these often suggest areas for further study. For example, a study of remote work stress might recommend exploring "the long-term effects of isolation on stress and team cohesion." Use these recommendations to refine your dissertation topic.

## Strategy 2: Master the "Zoom and Focus" Technique to Narrow Down Your Dissertation Topic

The "Zoom and Focus" technique helps you refine a broad interest into a precise and impactful research question for your dissertation. Here’s a simplified process:

Step 1: Start with Your Passion Identify a broad area that excites you. Examples include:

Environmental Science: Climate change adaptation

Computer Science: Artificial intelligence (AI)

Step 2: Zoom In on a Specific Aspect Narrow your focus by selecting a specific aspect of your broad interest. For instance:

Environmental Science: Urban resilience to climate change

Computer Science: AI in healthcare diagnostics

Step 3: Focus on a Unique Context Identify specific problems, settings, or challenges within your focus area. Investigate existing research to find underexplored areas. For example:

Green Infrastructure: If you are interested in green roofs, examine their effectiveness in specific contexts, such as flood mitigation in coastal cities. You might find limited research on their impact in cities like Miami or New Orleans.

Step 4: Narrow down to specific contexts by focusing on addressing particular settings or populations for your dissertation. For instance:

Choose a Specific Setting: Instead of studying green roofs broadly, concentrate on “coastal cities like Miami or New Orleans,” where flood risks are significant.

Focus on a Particular Group or Application: For AI, narrow down from general healthcare to “AI diagnostics for rare pediatric diseases,” ensuring your research addresses a critical need within a specific group.

## Putting It All Together

By starting with a broad interest and progressively narrowing your focus, you can develop a dissertation topic that is both specific and impactful. For example:

Environmental Science: Refine from “climate change adaptation” to “the effectiveness of green roofs in mitigating flooding in coastal cities during hurricane season.”

Computer Science: Narrow from “AI in healthcare” to “AI tools for diagnosing Duchenne muscular dystrophy in children.”

## Strategy 3: Align Your Dissertation Topic with Your Career Goals

Your dissertation can be a powerful tool for launching your career. Here’s how to ensure it aligns with your professional aspirations:

Step 1: Identify Your Post-PhD Aspirations Clarify your career goals. For instance, if you're an environmental science student aiming for a career in sustainable urban planning, think about how your dissertation can support this ambition.

Step 2: [Research Industry Trends](https://scholar.google.com/) Investigate the latest trends in your field and align your dissertation with areas in high demand. For example, you might find a growing need for expertise in green infrastructure and climate resilience in urban planning.

## Balancing Personal Interests and Career Goals

Striking a balance between your passions and career aspirations is key. Here’s how to achieve this:

List your top 3 research interests (e.g., urban resilience, AI, postcolonial literature).

List your top 3 career goals (e.g., consulting, academia, policy work).

Look for overlaps between these lists and frame your interests to align with industry needs.

## From Concept to Completion: Your Next Steps

Selecting your dissertation topic is just the beginning. As you progress through your doctoral studies, you'll face challenges in methodology, data analysis, and writing. Each stage offers opportunities for growth and discovery.

## Page 9: Student Debt: Avoiding, Minimizing, and Paying – DissertationPrep

_By Dr Lonny Ness_

There has been much press recently regarding the student debt crisis. One measure of this crisis is the Debt-to-Income Ratio as it relates to student loan debt. According to Earnest, the average doctoral student comes away with $103k to $130k in student debt. Of course, as an average, some debt balances were much higher.

- Pay Right Away
- Sign up for Automatic Debit
- Pay More than Your Minimum Payment
- Use Your Tax Refund
- Seek Out Forgiveness and Repayment Options

In a parallel article by the same organization, forgiveness and repayment options may apply to the following:

- Teacher Loan Forgiveness
- Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)
- Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) Plan
- Military Service
- AmeriCorps

Of course, when possible, avoid debt altogether. According to finance expert, Dave Ramsey (who has an excellent [blog](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/debt/student-loan-crisis) on the topic), in an article written by noted authority and author, Anthony O’Neal, “58% of them \[young professionals\] said their student loan burden has kept them from achieving goals. Seventy-four percent of them said if they could go back, they wouldn’t take out those loans. Living in regret isn’t emotionally healthy for anyone.”

Therefore, a proactive question is “How do students avoid or minimize debt?” Edvisors offers the following approaches:

- Exhaust sources of free money, such as grants and scholarships, before turning to student loans.
- Save as much as possible before enrolling in college.
- Enroll at a less expensive college.
- Use a tuition installment plan instead of long-term loan debt.
- Students should budget before they borrow.
- Students should also figure out how they will repay the student loans before they borrow, as it is easier to reduce debt before it is incurred than afterward.
- Consider costs beyond tuition, which represent about half of the debt
- Students can work part-time during the term and full-time during the summer to earn money to pay for school.
- Pay the interest during the in-school and grace periods to keep the loan balance from growing.
- Graduate on-time.
- Keep student loan debt in sync with income.

A mindset that appears evident today is that debt is okay as earning a degree will result in greater job opportunities and earnings, from which debt can be paid. There is some truth to this as the higher the degree, the better the job (generally); however, like any business, there is a Return on Investment (ROI) to consider. How much does your education cost, and how much more will you earn as a result? Further, will the increased income, if any, be sufficient to pay off the loan? In how many years? Again, LendEDU analyzed this dynamic relative to the Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio across different degree majors and careers, including the starting median salary and projected monthly income, relative to the student debt incurred. By understanding the dynamics and interaction between debt and potential income, based on degree, students can make more informed and better decisions regarding their degree, based on fund availability and possible debt.

Finally, [BankRate.com](https://www.bankrate.com/) conducted a study that found 61% of millennials don’t own a home and nearly a quarter of them attribute student loan debt as the cause. To help combat this issue, BankRate provides mortgage assistance programs and the requirements for each as well as six financial steps to improve the chances of getting approved for a mortgage. Click here for BankRate’s guide “ [How to buy a house when you have student loan debt](https://www.bankrate.com/loans/student-loans/student-loans-affect-buying-a-house/)”.

In conclusion, approach education in wisdom and full recognition that your degree may or may not result in a better job or income, plus the stress and anxiety that having debt brings - and the limitations that come with it. Again, avoid debt if possible, but if already in debt, use these steps to pay off as soon as possible to move forward with life and dreams.

## Page 11: The Oral Defense: Learner Know Thy Research! – DissertationPrep

_By Dr Lonny Ness_

If you are at the oral defense stage for your dissertation/thesis/doctoral study! - **Congratulations**

The oral defense is much feared, yet desired, for most doctoral students as it marks the end of the road. However, the oral defense also possibly represents the biggest challenge and test culminating one’s doctoral journey. According to SMU (n.d., para. 1)

> An oral defense or viva is an oral examination in which a student defends his/her thesis to an audience of experts as part of the requirement for his/her degree.

Further, the term “defend” is very important to help understand the nature of the oral defense. According to Merriam-Webster (n.d.), the term “defend” includes the following:

> 1. To maintain or support in the face of argument or hostile criticism
>
>     // _defend_ a theory
>
>     // couldn't _defend_ their actions
> 2. To prove (something, such as a doctoral thesis or dissertation) valid by answering questions in an oral exam
>
>     // preparing to _defend_ her thesis

Based on the above, to defend one’s dissertation orally (i.e., in person, with the committee present, along with potentially other school officials and students) requires an intimate knowledge of the research and analysis that was conducted - including any possible questions pertaining to the study.

From experience, I’ve concluded that the oral defense serves two primary purposes:

1. To satisfy academic criteria that the completed study is (a) rigorous, (b) reflects doctoral-level research, and (c) was, in fact, conducted by the learner
2. To gather the committee and interested parties in celebration of the work completed by the learner.

Describing the oral defense, Paul T. P. Wong, Ph.D., C.Psych., Former Research Director, Graduate Program in Counseling Psychology, Trinity Western University, Langley, BC, Canada, offers some useful insights regarding preparing for the oral defense - including being well prepared - academically, mentally, and physically. See Dr. Wong’s blog post for a full list.

Based on my experience in supervising (chairing) many mentees through this important phase is the criteria to be prepared. One would assume that after years of work on their dissertation that preparation would not be a problem, yet, I’ve seen instances where mentees were not prepared as evidenced by:

- Having to look up portions of their research to respond to questions (awkward during the defense)
- Not knowing how to answer (typically, a lack of understanding regarding the work conducted)

In the latter instance, the student hired a statistician to analyze the collected data and had no idea why the null hypotheses were rejected, or not. This was indeed unfortunate as the learner did not pass the oral defense at that time, but fortunately, was allowed to reschedule for a successful defense.

In conclusion, **BE PREPARED!** Be responsible for your own research - even if someone else was hired to assist, such as a coach, editor, or statistician. Prepare and follow your presentation speaking notes and avoid reading from the slides (if used). Again, be confident in the knowledge of your dissertation; thereby, convincing the attendees (committee) that you are indeed the one who conducted the research and gain their confidence in you as the research and associated study.

Have you been in this situation, where your dissertation chair/advisor/supervisor/committee tells you that you need to hire an editor (and will not approve your paper until you do), but you are already low on funds, or in debt due to your academic and/or living expenses? There are options, and hope!

To be clear, editors are worth their weight in gold and are by far worth the investment - whether you are told you need an editor, or not. However, editors can be expensive and may be beyond the budget for many doctoral and higher education students living on a shoestring.

What services can you expect from an editor?

- Word-by-Word review grammar, spelling, and formatting (e.g., APA)
- High-level reviews with recommendation for revision
- Grammar, spelling, and formatting corrections

What should not be expected from an editor is to create content, such as ghost-writing, as this is not appropriate and should be avoided. However, when an editor is mandatory for dissertation/thesis approval, then find an editor that offers a variety of service and pricing options. For instance, at Dissertation Prep, we offer full (word-by-word) as well as high-level (major errors). In addition, we can serve as your writing coach throughout the remainder of your degree. Contact Us FOr Information!

If you are in need of editing (almost everyone is), but low on funds to hire a qualified editor, here are a few resources that may help:

- [Grammarly Free Checker](https://www.grammarly.com/)
- [Citation Machine](http://www.citationmachine.net/)
- [Hemingway App](https://hemingwayapp.com/)
- [Ginger Software (Grammar Checker)](https://www.gingersoftware.com/grammarcheck)
- [Article Checker (Essay and Plagiarism Checker)](https://www.articlechecker.com/)
- [Stylewriter (low cost, not free)](https://www.editorsoftware.com/stylewriter/)
- [Purdue OWL Website (Writing, APA, MLA, Chicago Style, and more!)](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/)
- Microsoft Word (has extensive grammar and spell-checking features)
- University Writing Centers - Many available to the public at no charge! A good example is the [Walden University Writing Center](https://academicguides.waldenu.edu/writingcenter)
- [https://www.englishcentral.com/ (learn English)](https://www.englishcentral.com/browse/videos)
- [https://oatd.org/](https://oatd.org/) (Open Access Theses and Dissertations)
- [https://writer.com/](https://writer.com/) (Writer)

What are other sources that you have found? Send us your comment, with a link, and I will update this blog post as new resources are found.

In conclusion, although these (and other) free writing resources exist, doctoral students should be cautious about over-reliance on these resources as the idiom “you get what you pay for” often applies. As mentioned earlier, the work and role of an editor is invaluable in achieving one’s doctorate. Regardless, students must take responsibility for their own work and success; therefore, early planning and budgeting should factor in the cost of an editor at various stages of the doctoral journey. What are your experiences?

If you still need an editor, contact us for more information.

Description: Burnout for Doctoral learners is real! Our dissertation prep coaches can help. Created by 20+ year doctor mentor Dr. Dani Babb, our small business helps doctoral learners get and stay on track!

_By Dr Lonny Ness_

Higher education is demanding, but at the same time both rewarding and frustrating. Students at this level are by their very nature, over achievers. As such, the tendency is to keep their nose to the grindstone early in the program to see immediate results and strive for program completion as soon as possible. However, as has been widely stated, a doctorate is more of a marathon than a sprint. Therefore, the key is for students to balance and to pace themselves. I often find students over-committing and then experiencing stress and burnout. There are definitely periods where intense focus and long hours are required, but that should not be occurring regularly or for long periods.

According to Rutgers (n.d.)

I believe our culture fosters the delusion that if we just work harder, everything will fall into place. **Unchecked, relentless stress leads to burnout**, where those limited resources that were being drawn on by everything going on in life have been completely used up

To deal with stress and burnout, Rutgers (n.d.) continues to suggest the following remedies:

- **Start and end your day with a relaxing activity/ritual**
- **Unplug from technology daily**
- **Separation of home and lab**
- **Set boundaries and be assertive in prioritizing your well-being**
- **Tell someone!**
- **Take breaks and time off**
- **Utilize support systems**

In conclusion, Rutgers (n.d.) offers:

When the burnout has already happened, **it’s not too late!** After you’ve reached your breaking point, it’s time to employ more intense strategies.

As a dissertation coach, I regularly work with clients who are experiencing tremendous stress levels - for various reasons - including a lack of progress in the doctoral program, a lack of support and communications from their supervisor/chair/advisor, and/or time limit on their doctorate program is nearing an end (typical limit is 7 years). According to O’Shaunessy (2012), the average student requires 8.2 years! This is confirmed by Gradeschools.com (2019) as most students require 5-6 years, with many between 7-9 years to graduate. With the average time-to-completion of 6+ years for doctoral degrees (tbd), it’s easy to see that any, or all of these factors may be experienced.

Working with a dissertation coach can help relieve PhD stress by:

- **Establishing a plan for completion**
- **Having a “voice” with regular feedback**
- **Measurable progress and “successes”**
- **A “go-to” resource for timely and expert advise and encouragement**
- **Quicker PhD completion \***
- **Lower overall tuition (and debt) \***
- While quicker completion and lower costs are the goal, these cannot be guaranteed due to processes outside the control of the dissertation coach

In conclusion, stressors exist for those pursuing a doctorate, and are often unavoidable; however, these do not need to control and limit success, but can be managed to help reduce the impact on the student.

We have coaches who are committed and trained to provide emotional support and milestones with plans of actions for doctoral students.

## Page 14: Qualitative, Descriptive, versus Quantitative Data – DissertationPrep

Description: Our statisticians help doctoral learners with their statistics through their dissertation process! Stats may be used for quantitative data analysis, but is not used exclusively for this purpose. Descriptive data used for quantitative analysis is known as descriptive quantitative research approach...

_By Dr Lonny Ness_

I was reminded today that some doctoral students automatically classify the collection of numbers as reflective of quantitative research. However, numbers-alone may be suitable for either qualitative or quantitative research. Why? This is true based on the use of the numbers collected. Let’s examine further…

In the example given today, the student stated that numbers, such as those responding to questions such as “how many'' are quantitative. While this is partially correct, in that, quantitative research deals with statistics, which are numbers-based, it is not entirely correct that the numerical data collected could only be used for quantitative research. Examining further, there is a classification of numerical data known as descriptive statistics, which generally deal with frequency, central tendency (mean, median, and mode), dispersion, and position (Compuslab, n.d.). Descriptive statistic, as such, “describe” the population from which data was collected, which is often applied for both qualitative, quantitative, and mixed research, but should not be confused with quantitative data analysis, which deals with correlations, relationships, and differences among predictor (independent) and outcome/criterion (dependent) variables. To be clear, descriptive statistics may be used (although weaker) for quantitative data analysis, but is not used exclusively for this purpose.

Descriptive data used for quantitative analysis is known as descriptive quantitative research approach (Quora, 2019) and should be distinguished from correlational, quasi-experimental (or causal-comparative), and experimental. Descriptive data used for qualitative research simply describes the population or may be used as evidence of a phenomenon being explored for open-ended inquiry (whereas quantitative is closed-ended). For mixed method research, the same applies, but potentially for both qualitative and quantitative purposes.

DISCLAIMER: Dr. Lonny is not a statistician. All opinions expressed are based on learning and experience via doctoral research, mentoring, and coaching. We do HAVE statisticians on board!

Description: The doctoral journey is a new experience for students. Do you question why 36- 51% of students do not complete their doctorate? We help doctoral students with superb coaching and editing dissertations at Dissertation Prep

_By Dr Lonny Ness_

## LIONS, AND TIGERS, AND BEARS - OH MY

The doctoral journey is a new, and often, daunting experience for students. Much like Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz, students find themselves in an unknown environment, with people they don’t know, who may seem odd, and are told to proceed in a direction that they’ve never traveled to a place they’ve never been. Sound familiar? Is it any wonder that 36- 51% of students do not complete their doctorate (Young, Vanwye, Schafer, Robertson, & Poore, 2019)?

Extending the Oz-as-doctorate paradigm, just as the Yellow Brick Road provides a path to Oz, so do universities provide the courses and deliverables to earn a doctorate, including (in most cases) a topic, proposal, and dissertation – ending with an oral defense. Like the road to Oz, there are many twists, turns, and dangers when pursuing a doctorate. For instance, recalling Dorothy’s journey to Oz along the Yellow Brick Road, there were various dangers and trials, including a wicked witch throwing fireballs, an enchanted apple tree orchard, sleepy poppy field, then those pesky flying monkeys!

What are some of the speedbumps, pitfalls, and other dangers along the road to your doctorate? Here’s a basic list, but there are many more!

- A non-researchable topic (see explanation below)
- Lack of Research Rigor
- Non-Alignment with University Criteria
- Lack of Recent/Scholarly Literature
- Lack of Data (topic is too narrow or a small population)
- Time to Completion (7 year max for many universities)

Probably the most important step in beginning the doctoral journey is topic selection. This is covered in more depth in another blog post, but the keys are to avoid a topic that’s overly complex or encompassing (“boiling the ocean”), or conversely, that’s too narrow. A narrow topic may result in a lack of supporting literature, population, and/or data to collect for analysis. Your chair/coach can help guide you through this very important step.

As a dissertation coach, mentor, professor, and chair, I advise students that this is their first time to travel to “Oz” and that they are likely unaware of the dangers and risks that await them. However, as both a doctoral graduate and guide, I’ve been down that path numerous times. Further, while most experienced coaches/chairs can readily anticipate and avoid possible problems, the best coaches/chairs can help navigate and diffuse unforeseen issues when they occur (and they usually do occur).

How is your doctoral journey? Are you well on your way to “Oz”? Do you have an experienced coach and/or chair to guide you? If not, contact Dr. Lonny for a free initial review and consultation – no obligation!

## Page 16: Dissertation Research Questions: Do’s and Don’ts – DissertationPrep

Date: 2024-07-16
Description: The do’s and dont’s of dissertation research questions! Some key tips to formulating a great dissertation research question. At Dissertation Prep, we help coach doctoral students to success.

_By Dr Lonny Ness_

Dissertation research questions are glue, and where the rubber meets the road for doctoral inquiry as they reflect the problem and purpose, then drive the associated research method and design for study completion. As such, properly formed research questions are imperative to study success!

Dissertation research questions look different depending on whether they are qualitative or quantitative. Here’s a few tips, with examples, for each:

## QUALITATIVE

- Key Points:
  - Focus on open-ended “how”, “why” or sometimes “what” questions
  - Avoid yes/no questions, e.g., “is”, “are”, etc.
  - Avoid personalizing questions, e.g., “you” as these are lower-level questions reserved for data collection, such as interviews

To illustrate:

- How do managers decide who to promote?
- Why are men promoted more often than women?
- What criteria do manager’s apply when making a promotion decision?

## QUANTITATIVE

- Key Points:
  - There must be at least one predictor/independent and one outcome/dependent [variable](https://statistics.laerd.com/statistical-guides/types-of-variable.php) for each quantitative research question
  - The DV reflects the problem to be studied and the IV(s) reflect the gap in the literature requiring further (quantitative) research
  - Variables must be measurable, and typically from a pre-validated survey or secondary-data (avoid creating your own survey instrument, if possible)
  - Generally, [data types](https://www.graphpad.com/support/faqid/1089/) for parametric testing, both the IV and DV are either ordinal (e.g., 0-7), interval (measureable between digits), or ratio (interval including zero) data types. However, for [causal comparative](https://cirt.gcu.edu/research/developmentresources/research_ready/comparative/causal), the IVs are generally nominal (e.g., yes/no, male/female, etc.)
  - For [correlations](https://cirt.gcu.edu/research/developmentresources/research_ready/correlation/overview), use the form: “To what extent does \[IV\] relate to \[DV\]?”, or similarly, “To what extent does \[IV\] predict \[DV\]?”. or similar
  - For causal comparative, use the form: “To what extent does \[DV\] differ, based on \[IV\]?”, or similar

To illustrate:

- To what extent does the manager’s years of experience relate to the percent of females promoted within the organization? (correlational)
- To what extent do the percent of females promoted within the organization differ, based on the manager’s gender? (causal-comparative)

## Page 17: Why a Doctorate? Part 2 – Pros and Conclusion – DissertationPrep
URL: https://dissertationprep.com/blogs/blog/why-a-doctorate-part-2-pros-and-conclusion
Date: 2024-07-09
Description: There are many downsides to earning a doctoral degree, whether you want to earn a PhD, DBA, EdD or another professional degree. However, with good coaching and editing services, we can help mitigate those downsides to improve your overall experience! Studies show greater earning potential and lifelong job stability.

_By Dr Lonny Ness_

## Introduction

In Why a Doctorate – Part 1, the reasons not to pursue (cons) were covered; however, if earning a doctorate is your passion (or requirement) and no sacrifice or challenge is too great, then I trust that this list of reasons (pros) to earn a doctorate will encourage you.

## Part 2 - Pros

Here are some of the pros when considering a doctorate. Are there others? Let us know!

Company-sponsored educational benefit. No/low cost. Many professionals work for a company that offers tuition aid/assistance as a way to improve employee skills, promotion, and retention. This was true for my employer (before switching careers to online teaching and coaching) and I was able to take full advantage of the opportunity by paying a minimal amount out-of-pocket (although I needed to pass courses for reimbursement). Unfortunately, according to Berman (2018), approximately 90% of mid- to large employers offer some type of educational assistance; however, only 10% of employees take advantage of this benefit. Have you checked your employee benefits? If offered, financial assistance may make your decision to pursue a doctorate much easier.

Career. Promotion or new job along with increased earnings/income. Earning a doctorate provides the highest earning potential over any other degree, with potential side benefits of security and career flexibility (What Are the Benefits of Earning a Doctorate?, 2019). For me, earning my PhD allowed me to leave my corporate job (after learning that my job was going out-of-state), and switch to teaching at online universities. The career switch also improved flexibility to the point that my motto/criteria for accepting job opportunities became “I will only accept jobs that I can do from a cruise ship”. While this may sound fun, yet simplistic, it really has worked well for me. 😊

Prestige. Being recognized as "Dr." the rest of your life. According to Segesten (2012),

_Harking back to a time when these diplomas were reserved for a minuscule segment of the population, the doctoral degree is seen as a prestige marker, the recognition of one's exceptional talents and the certificate of belonging to the intellectual elite. The non-material rewards that a PhD is supposed to bring, at least theoretically, are connected to social standing; PhDs can be used as a vehicle for upwards social mobility, and for the fulfillment of personal and family ambitions._

While intangible, there is a certain pride and self-esteem that comes with both completing a doctorate, as well as the title earned, whether PhD, EdD, DBA, and others, but in all cases, Dr. When students and clients ask what to call me, I joke (not really though) that they can call me anything as long as it begins with “Dr.” 😊 What is your primary reason for earning a doctorate? Is prestige one reason?

Knowledge and Self-Actualization. Fulfilling a life-long dream and/or transforming from practitioner to scholar. Again, according to Segesten (2012), “PhD students are those with a high degree of personal motivation that stems from their natural curiosity and love of intellectual pursuits.” Possibly the greatest outcome and realization of my own doctoral achievement was the recognition that I had become more scholarly and able to critically analyze research, as well as construct knowledge via my own research of reliable and peer-reviewed sources. I’ve received similar feedback from many mentees during their oral defense – reflecting on their doctoral journey and achievement.

In conclusion, there are several reasons for and against earning a doctorate, which vary for each individual. For me, the pros far outweigh the cons – mainly due to our children being grown and having the benefit of a company tuition reimbursement program. Plus our middle son was accepted to a prestigious university’s doctorate program and I wanted to join him in this pursuit (honestly, I wanted to be the first!). Also, as I am the first in my family to earn a higher education degree, there was certainly a level of prestige involved. How about you? Do the pros outweigh the cons? Are you ready to pursue your doctorate? Stay tuned, as upcoming blogs will address selecting a doctoral-granting institution, then on to the doctorate process and dissertation.

## Page 18: Plagiarism versus Originality: Causes and Solutions – DissertationPrep

Date: 2024-07-09
Description: Plagiarism versus Originality: Causes and Solutions for doctoral students working on a dissertation. The doctoral study must be free from plagiarism and while tools can help, our editors help doctoral students avoid plagiarism and write with originality!

_By Dr Lonny Ness_

Originality is how unique one’s writing is. In academic circles, this is known as having your own “voice”. Originality is measured by the similarity score, between 0 and 100, with 100 meaning 100% similarity – meaning that the writing was completely copied from another source, or sources, which is not good and should be avoided. Many schools now integrate the plagiarism checkers into classrooms to help stave off this avalanche of students cheating.

Common software used to check for originality (and plagiarism) by universities are [Turnitin](https://www.turnitin.com/) (turnitin.com) and [SafeAssign](https://safeassign.blackboard.com/) (a service of the learning management system – BlackBoard), as well as others. These are typically integrated into designated assignments, but can also be used by both professors and students to check similarity scores and sources – either in draft or final mode, with the latter adding the paper to the repository for subsequent use in checking future submissions.

As scholarly writers, we tend to focus on plagiarism – using your own or someone else's work without proper attribution (i.e., reference + citation). However, plagiarism isn’t the only writing offense! Less egregious, but equally frowned upon is having a high similarity score – meaning, whether cited, or not, someone else's words are being used. If not cited, then that’s plagiarism; however, if cited (which most are), then it is simply not your own work and is considered subpar for academic writing.

The penalty for plagiarism is typically a failing grade for the assignment after the first offense, with possible expulsion from the program for repeated offenses. Conversely, the penalty for high similarity (typically over 20%), can result in a grading deduction – up to a failing grade for the specific assignment.

Here are some steps to take to help avoid plagiarism and to improve originality:

- Cite EVERYTHING! Ensure that EVERY assertation and statement of fact is cited. If it is your own opinion or knowledge, say so. Otherwise, provide a citation.
- Avoid quotes. Paraphrase the work of others in your own words – with citations.
- Use software and services to check papers prior to submission. Time is critical. Plagiarism and high similarity often result when students do not allow enough time to properly complete assignments/papers.

As mentioned, your university likely offers a similarity/plagiarism-checking tool, but here are some that you can use on your own:

- [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) – Grammarly’s plagiarism checker detects plagiarism in your text and checks for other writing issues
- [Plagiarism Checker Software](https://www.plagiarismsoftware.com/) – This online plagiarism checker guarantees you that it runs a thorough plagiarism test for your content to verify that the content is 100% percent plagiarism free.

## Page 19: Dissertation Topic Selection: A Critical Choice Toward Doctoral Succes – DissertationPrep
URL: https://dissertationprep.com/blogs/blog/dissertation-topic-selection-a-critical-choice-toward-doctoral-success-or-failure
Date: 2024-07-02
Description: Dissertation Prep helps doctoral students select a dissertation topic to help set students up for success. Our coaches can start from the getgo to help ensure your ease in selecting a dissertation topic and moving forward in your study.

_By Dr Lonny Ness_

I was advising a student today in an introductory doctoral course about the importance of dissertation topic selection and thought I would share my thoughts here…

The reason why I say that topic selection is critical towards doctoral success or failure is that one’s dissertation topic involves numerous factors, including:

- The phenomenon studied (e.g., business, IT, education, psych, etc.)
- The method (qualitative or quantitative – avoid mixed!)
- The population
- The geography
- …and more!

Parenthetically, per APA, the topic title should be within 10-12 words. Quite a feat to get all the above within such a limited space – but it can be done! For more detail on the elements of the topic, check out my lesson topic selection and development…

Beyond the topic elements, the key point for this blog post is the importance of choosing a dissertation topic that will ultimately and successfully facilitate graduation within one’s expectations for time and cost. The key for success? DATA COLLECTION!!! Really? YES!!! Why? Great question!

Several topics involve difficult to obtain data, for several reasons. Here’s a few:

- Too narrow of a topic, population, or geography – resulting in too few participants to satisfy the criteria for sampling
- Too sensitive of a topic – restricting participation and/or responses. An example is unethical business practices – who wants to admit to being unethical? Another example is a protected population, such as minors, pregnant women, and prisoners.
- Potential human harm – resulting in IRB delays or non-approval
- Highly expensive data collection – count the cost!

Is it impossible to complete a dissertation given the above caution areas? Certainly not, but it does potentially make it much more difficult with lengthy time delays and cost. I’ve coached many students who breezed through proposal development and IRB only to hit a roadblock once data collection started – in some cases requiring extensive research design changes and re-approval through committee, school, and IRB to restart data collection. This should, and can be avoided early in the process by carefully choosing the dissertation topic and understanding the associated population and data collection criteria.

Is this something that you would like assistance with?

## Page 20: Using Editing Software vs Hiring an Editor – DissertationPrep
URL: https://dissertationprep.com/blogs/blog/using-editing-software-vs-hiring-an-editor
Date: 2024-06-25
Description: Many doctoral students rely on editing software for their dissertation. is it reliable? do you need an editor? we provide dissertation editing services as well! this article discusses the pros and cons of software for editing.

_By Dr Lonny Ness_

In this blog post, I will discuss the use of editing software versus hiring a professional editor for improved academic writing, grammar, and formatting (i.e. Word, APA, etc.). As a dissertation coach, we also offer high-level editing services. My secret to great editing and feedback – superior software, plus extensive expertise. While most doctoral students lack expertise, they can certainly gain an advantage by utilizing top-notch editing/grammar software, such as Grammarly and Stylewriter.

## Leading Grammar and Editing Software Providers:

[Grammarly’s](https://www.grammarly.com/) key features include:

- Compose bold, clear, mistake-free writing with Grammarly’s AI-powered writing assistant.
- Get corrections from Grammarly while you write on Gmail, Twitter, LinkedIn, and all your other favorite sites.
- From grammar and spelling to style and tone, Grammarly helps you eliminate errors and find the perfect words to express yourself.
- Grammarly’s plagiarism checker detects plagiarism in your text and checks for other writing issues.

[Stylewriter’s](https://www.editorsoftware.com/stylewriter/) key features include:

- StyleWriter’s editing advice shows you how to transform your writing into a clear, concise and professional writing style.
- StyleWriter highlights jargon phrases, difficult words and acronyms and abbreviations to help you write in a jargon-free style.
- StyleWriter’s Smart-Spell technology checks for spelling errors and spelling inconsistencies missed by other programs.
- StyleWriter uses a revolutionary 200,000 graded word list to offer meaningful statistics and ratings you can use to become a better writer.
- StyleWriter is the only writing aid you can fully customize to your writing needs. Organizations can computerize their existing house style rules.
- StyleWriter lets you select from 20 writing tasks and three audience types, including academic, advertising, legal writing, memos and more.

Both Grammarly and Stylewriter are great tools for improved writing and grammar, but work very differently from each other – with different feedback provided, based on varying criteria. Therefore, I recommend that clients and mentees purchase both. With reasonable pricing – especially as compared to the cost of tuition, they are well worth the investment! Dr. Babb’s addition: - do not overly rely on these tools!

As a writing coach and editor (as part of my dissertation coaching services), I use these products (along with expertise), but always advise these for my clients and university mentees for two reasons: (a) they are empowered to produce better quality writing and work, and (b) they save money and time! Isn’t that what you want too? Of course!

Other benefits a professional editor provides are:

- Microsoft Word formatting (headings, TOC, pagination, etc.)
- Writing style (e.g., MEAL Plan)
- Writing/formatting convention compliance (APA, and others)
- Fine-tuning – While software can identify errors, making corrections is entirely another matter. An editor can assist with corrections such as passive voice, anthropomorphisms, vague terms, wordiness, and others.

In conclusion, my advice for all academic students, as well as writers, in general, is to purchase one or both of the above software packages, and also use an editor to ensure completion before sending your work to your chair.

Date: 2024-06-18
Description: Dissertation Prep helps doctoral students edit and format in APA version 6 and 7. Here are some of the basics of APA 6 formatting, with much more to learn!

_By Dr Lonny Ness_

APA formatting can be very challenging as there are many (some obscure) rules to remember. I wanted to point out a couple nuances regarding APA reference formatting that you may not be aware of.

Here are some of the more common errors I see on a daily basis for my students and clients:

- For each periodical (journal), there must be either a DOI or “retrieved from” URL. The DOI takes precedence over the URL, if present. To locate the DOI, search for the title at crossref.org. If a DOI is not available, use the journal’s homepage URL as the retrieved from source – not the database (e.g., Proquest).
- The inclusion of an issue number implies that each issue begins on page 1, if not, omit the issue #. However, to determine this, multiple issues must be observed at the journal homepage – this takes work!
- Only capitalize the first word of the title and subtitle.
- Italicize the journal name and volume number, or the book title.
- Only use the authors first and middle initials – not their full names
- Use a number for units of measure, e.g., “5 years”, even if less than 10
- Always use past tense for cited sources, e.g., “Smith (2019) stated…”
- Avoid anthropomorphisms/personifications, e.g., “The study asserted…”

Note here that the author(s) asserted, not the study!

Do any of these look familiar? How does your paper align? Also, do you have the APA Manual? Have you read it from front to back – with highlights?

Note that APA Style Manual - Version 7 has recently been released. The above tips will be reviewed and reposted to reflect any changes. Stay tuned!

### _However, with good coaching and editing services, we can help mitigate those downsides to improve your overall experience._

_By Dr Lonny Ness_

## Introduction

“ _The road to a doctorate is long, arduous, and paved with abandoned scholarship. Don’t start the PhD process before you consider all the obstacles (and rewards)_“.

Why You Shouldn’t Get a PhD (2019)

There are many valid reasons why one should pursue obtaining a doctorate, or not. In this post, I will explore both the pros and downsides of obtaining this pinnacle of scholarly degrees, along with resources for further research.

I will begin with the reasons not to pursue a doctorate (PhD, EdD, DBA, PsyD, etc.) as the reasons not to likely outweigh those in favor of a doctorate. In fact, completing a doctorate often requires great sacrifice of time, money, relationships, and more, so one must be prepared and weigh the costs beforehand.

## Downsides

Money. As of 2023, U.S. student loans reached an all-time high at 1.7 trillion (Nerd Wallet, 2023). Student loans and debt can be overwhelming, which typically cannot be earned in one’s lifetime via a promotion or career change, such as teaching. I’ve worked with clients/mentees who owed over $100k+ and without a job prospect once their degree was earned, if successful. Others are pursuing their doctorate for advancement at their current job, or to retain their position, but at what cost? For what benefit? How long would it take to repay the cost, based on the job obtained/retained? If money is not an issue, or company-sponsored, that’s great, but still check out these other downsides to assess the total impact before deciding.

Time. Needless to say, a doctorate takes time – lots of time, and over an extended time. In my experience, a doctorate typically takes 3-5 years, with up to 7 years permitted by most online universities; however, according to O’Shaunessy (2012), the average student requires 8.2 years! This is confirmed by Gradeschools.com (2019) as most students require 5-6 years, with many between 7-9 years to graduate. As I often advise doctoral students, this journey is a marathon, not a sprint. Consider the race to be run before beginning!

Career. In most cases, pursuing a doctorate is for the purpose of expanding or improving one’s career; however, there are also negatives to consider. First, does your employer support your decision? How would “support” look to you? Eliminating overtime? Allowing use of the work computer? In my case, although the company had tuition reimbursement, my boss clearly stated that earning a doctorate degree would not benefit my job status whatsoever, so I knew I would be on my own – regardless of the outcome. In some cases, negative consequences have resulted from completing one’s research on their own company (which I do not recommend), in that, the findings uncovered aspects of the business that they did not like, or want published. It would be optimal to have a discussion with your supervisor regarding your intent to pursue a doctorate, including whatever expectations you have for their support. Also, be aware that personnel change, so whoever you have the initial discussion from – including any agreements for support, may change into your degree program, so consider obtaining written agreement up-front.

Health. Given the stress, health can certainly be affected, which is normal, so plan to eat healthy, exercise, get enough sleep, work in moderation – as possible, and maintain a positive attitude, throughout. However, if there are any health issues going into the doctorate, be aware of the added challenges that may have. Also, be aware that for certain conditions, schools offer academic accommodations for this with a documented disability, which will ease the burden somewhat by extending due dates.

Relationships. It is commonly known that the pressures of money, time, career, and health over an extended period of time can negatively affect relationships. Before deciding to pursue a doctorate, ensure that you have full support from family, especially if married. All those who are close to you will need to adjust based on your new schedule for studying, research, writing, etc.

In conclusion, while the downsides of getting a doctorate paint a bleak picture, there are still many reasons in favor of earning a doctorate (see Part 2). The key is to be informed of the downsides beforehand and make the best decision for yourself, family, and others. If you’ve reviewed these downsides and still want to pursue a doctorate – CONGRATULATIONS! Now, let’s get you through it! See Part 2 for the continuation of “Why a Doctorate”, focusing on the pros.

Date: 2024-05-16
Description: "Preventing Burnout: A Doctoral Student's Guide" advises on managing time, optimizing resources, constructing support systems, and upholding self-care to ensure success in handling the dissertation process and avoiding burnout during PhD studies.

_By Nicole Dhanraj, Ph.D._

Juggling deadlines, family commitments, and the bottomless pit of doctoral writing can feel like a high-wire act with flaming chainsaws. But remember, you're not alone in this struggle! This is a shared reality for doctoral students. However, with the right strategies and unwavering determination, you cannot only survive but also thrive in this daunting doctoral journey.

## Understanding and Avoiding Burnout

Let's be honest – doctoral programs are demanding. Balancing work, family, and program demands can leave you feeling burnt out. Burnout manifests in various ways, including chronic fatigue, reduced productivity, and feelings of detachment.

Don't wait until you're running on fumes! Pace yourself, schedule rest, and remember, this is a marathon, not a sprint.

## Strategies for Doctoral Success

Here are some effective strategies to help manage the demands of family, work,you’re your doctoral journey.

## Time Management Mastery: Become a Scheduling Ninja

- Block out dedicated study time in your calendar and treat it like an important appointment
- Involve your family in creating the schedule and explain the importance of "quiet time."
- Use tools like Trello or Asana to create task lists and track progress.

## Time Chunking: Break down daunting tasks into bite-sized pieces.

- Try the Pomodoro Technique: 20-minute focused work sprints with energizing 10-minute breaks.
- Find a routine that fits your life, even if it's just 15 minutes daily for steady progress.

## Optimize Your Resources

- Harness the Power of Technology: Use note-taking apps like Evernote or OneNote to keep your thoughts organized. Explore time management apps like Todoist to break down large tasks into manageable steps. These tools are your allies in the battle against time constraints.

## Conquer Your Commute

- Use your commute time for listen, read or take notes.
- Close your eyes and catch up on rest or use the time to simply unwind.
- Dedicate your lunch break to focused study sessions or attend online seminars, or review your research, or even write. This could also be an excellent time to check in with your advisor or coach.

## Building Your Support System

- Seek Your Tribe: You don't have to go it alone. Lean on your partner, friends, fellow students, or even a therapist. Consider a doctoral student coach – even Olympians have coaches!
- Prioritize Self-Care: Remember, your well-being is as important as your academic progress. Schedule activities that nourish your mind, body, and soul. Whether it's meditation, a nature walk, or a favorite hobby, self-care is not just a luxury, it's essential for maintaining focus and productivity.

## Celebrate Every Victory!

## Page 24: Why You Should Consider a Pilot Study: Avoiding Research Roadblocks – DissertationPrep
URL: https://dissertationprep.com/blogs/blog/why-you-should-consider-a-pilot-study-avoiding-research-roadblocks
Date: 2024-03-19
Description: Discover the role of pilot studies in qualitative research on Dissertation Prep with Nicole Dhanraj's article. Learn how pilot studies refine research tools, identify biases, and enhance overall research validity.

_By Nicole Dhanraj, PhD - Doctoral Dissertation Coach_

Many doctoral students, especially those venturing into qualitative research, face a common challenge. They meticulously design their research, only to discover later that their instruments – interview guides, observation protocols, etc. – don't quite capture the rich data they need.

This experience can be a frustrating and time-consuming setback. This is where pilot studies come in. They're not just an extra step but a powerful pre-research tool that can significantly strengthen your entire qualitative research endeavor.

## What is a Pilot Study?

A pilot study is a small-scale, preliminary investigation that acts as a testing ground for your research instruments, methods, and procedures.

It's a critical step in the research process, allowing you to identify and address potential challenges before investing significant time and resources into your main study.

Think of it as a dress rehearsal, giving you, the researcher, the opportunity to rigorously review your research instruments and procedures in a controlled environment.

## The Extensive Benefits of Pilot Studies

Conducting a pilot study offers numerous benefits that can significantly enhance the quality and credibility of your qualitative research. Here are several reasons to consider a pilot study for your research.

Refining Research Instruments: Qualitative research often relies on interview guides, observation protocols, or focus group questions.

A pilot study allows you to test these instruments, identify ambiguities or confusing areas, and refine them to ensure they elicit rich and relevant data from participants.

**Example:** In a qualitative study exploring employee satisfaction, the pilot study involves testing interview questions to understand specific aspects of workplace culture.

The researcher discovers that certain questions lead to ambiguous responses, or the participants must ask many clarifying questions to understand what is being asked.

This prompts revisions to ensure clarity in the questions. This refinement ensures that the interview guide effectively captures the participant's experiences during the main study.

Sharpening Research Questions: The pilot study process can help refine and solidify your research questions.

As you gather data and interact with participants, you may discover new angles or areas for exploration that warrant further investigation in your main study.

**Example:** In a study on the impact of online learning on student engagement, the pilot study reveals unexpected themes emerging from participant interactions.

This prompts the researcher to reevaluate and refine the research questions to delve deeper into the identified themes, enriching the main study's focus and depth of inquiry.

(Note: Discuss unexpected themes with your advisor to ensure feasibility within your research design.)

Assessing Feasibility and Logistics: Pilot studies enable you to determine the feasibility of your proposed research methods, sampling strategies, and data collection procedures.

You can identify potential logistical issues, time constraints, or participant recruitment challenges that may arise during the main study and make adjustments accordingly.

**Example:** For a qualitative study of the experiences of healthcare providers during a pandemic, the pilot study highlights potential challenges in accessing certain participant groups due to scheduling conflicts.

This experience prompts adjustments to the sampling strategy, ensuring feasibility and addressing logistical issues that may impact participant recruitment and overall study execution.

This is crucial as you want to avoid being stuck trying to schedule participants, and it takes months for your data collection.

Identifying Participant Biases: The pilot study can offer insights into potential participant biases. Analyzing their responses may reveal unintended leading questions or areas where your research instruments might inadvertently influence their responses.

This insight allows you to refine your instruments and mitigate potential biases in the main study.

**Example:** In a qualitative study investigating public attitudes towards renewable energy policies, the pilot study unveils potential biases as participants hesitate to endorse certain policies framed with industry jargon.

Through detailed analysis, the researcher identifies linguistic barriers and revises question-wording to ensure neutrality, minimizing inadvertent biases in the main study and enhancing the reliability of participant responses.

Developing Research Skills: You are likely a novice researcher, so a pilot study serves as a valuable learning experience.

It allows you to practice your interviewing, observation, and data analysis skills in a smaller setting, helping you refine your techniques and gain confidence before embarking on the main study.

It also helps you gain confidence and remove some of the nervousness.

Instrument Reliability and Validity: Reliability refers to the degree to which an instrument yields stable and consistent results over repeated applications, while validity concerns the instrument's ability to capture the concept it is designed to assess accurately.

This means verifying that the tools used for data collection—such as surveys, questionnaires, or interview guides—consistently produce accurate and dependable results.

During a pilot study, the instruments are tested on a smaller scale to evaluate if they are clearly understood and if they measure what they are intended to measure.

## _When is a Pilot Study Necessary For My Doctoral Study?_

- While pilot studies are generally recommended for all qualitative research projects, there are certain situations where they are particularly crucial:
  - When using new or modified research instruments
  - When exploring a new research context or population
  - When employing novel or complex research methods
  - When conducting interdisciplinary or mixed-methods research

## When Might You Skip a Pilot Study?

While generally recommended, pilot studies may be unnecessary for doctoral studies involving:

- Well-established research methods with readily available instruments
- Extensive prior research in the area
- Simple and standardized procedures
- Limited resources or time constraints
- Clearly defined and tested instruments
- Exploratory research with limited structure
- However, proceed cautiously in these situations, considering potential risks and trade-offs.

## Embrace the Power of Pilot Studies

Unlike the main study, a pilot study's primary goal isn't data generation but validation and solidification of your research design.

Through this lens, you can proactively identify and address potential pitfalls related to study protocols, recruitment, data collection, and analysis.

This preemptive approach significantly contributes to avoiding costly errors and time-consuming revisions later, ultimately elevating your doctoral research's overall reliability and validity.

## Page 25: Defining Focus: Strategies for a Strong Dissertation Problem Statement – DissertationPrep
URL: https://dissertationprep.com/blogs/blog/defining-focus-strategies-for-a-strong-dissertation-problem-statement
Date: 2024-03-11
Description: Discover how to craft a strong dissertation problem statement with our guide. Use our three-step process to identify your research area, explore gaps, and refine your problem. Ideal for students across disciplines.

_By Nicole Dhanraj, PhD- Doctoral Dissertation Coach_

The problem statement is the cornerstone of your dissertation. However, you may encounter challenges when writing your dissertation problem statements, including struggles articulating a clear and specific research focus, difficulty narrowing down broad topics, and an insufficient understanding of existing literature.

Fear not! Here are three step-by-step guides to help you _define your focus_ as you develop your problem statement. This should remove the jitters on how to get started and address your committee concerns on a problem statement that is not focused.

1. Step 1: Identify the High-Level Area of Interest

    Begin by brainstorming a broad field within your discipline that piques your curiosity. Whether it's education, psychology, health, or international business, identifying this high-level area lays the groundwork for your problem statement.

1. Step 2: Exploring Your Research Landscape

What areas do you want to study in your selected field? What aspects ignite your curiosity? Reflect on your industry, considering the challenges or gaps highlighted in the existing literature. To guide your exploration, here are some examples across diverse fields:
   - Education: Student motivation, principals leadership styles, online learning effectiveness.
   - Psychology: Social media impact on adolescent self-esteem cross-cultural variations in emotional expression.
   - Health: Treatment adherence for chronic illness, utilization of technology to improve patient outcomes.
   - International Business: The influence of trust on business relationships in the manufacturer-foreign intermediary dyad, supply chain diversity, and the relationship to business outcomes.

1. Step 3: Research and Refine the Problem

Here's where the real digging begins. Immerse yourself in the existing literature related to your chosen area. Read academic journals, books, and relevant online resources. Consider specific subfields within your area of interest, exploring factors influencing your research focus. You can refine your broad problem using the following tactics.
1. Sharpen your focus. What are the subtopics of student motivation in education? You might find research on motivation linked to factors like self-efficacy, teacher expectations, peer relationships, income levels, or parental support. You could then sharpen your focus on student motivation to explore parental support's influence on student motivation. So, while you discovered that there is general research on student motivation, you can now drill into a specific area, such as examining how parental involvement impacts motivation levels.
2. Identifying knowledge gaps: As you delve deeper, you will start noticing inconsistencies, unanswered questions, or a lack of research in specific aspects of the field. Suppose you are exploring "treatment adherence in chronic illnesses." You might identify a knowledge gap regarding the impact of socioeconomic factors on treatment adherence. Existing research might lack a comprehensive understanding of how income levels influence patients' ability to adhere to long-term treatment plans.
3. Inconsistencies in Findings: Sometimes, research within a field might yield conflicting results. For instance, studies on the effectiveness of a particular teaching method might show positive outcomes in one context but not in another. This inconsistency highlights the need for further exploration to understand the factors influencing these contrasting results. Consider a psychology student researching mindfulness meditation might find studies reporting its effectiveness in reducing anxiety in adults but limited research on its impact on teenagers experiencing exam stress. This inconsistency points to a knowledge gap about mindfulness's effectiveness for this specific age group and context.
4. Unanswered Questions: As you critically analyze existing research, lingering questions might emerge. These unanswered questions often indicate areas where further investigation is needed. A business student studying the Relational Mechanisms of Manufacturer-Foreign Intermediary Relationships may find unanswered questions about export outcomes and business expansion success.
5. Lack of Research on Specific Populations or Contexts: While a significant amount of research might exist within your chosen field, studies might focus on specific demographics or contexts. If you are an education student interested in the impact of technology on student learning, you might find extensive research on computer-aided instruction in general classrooms. However, a gap might exist in exploring the effectiveness of these technologies in special education classrooms catering to students with diverse learning needs. This highlights the need for research on the specific context of special education.
6. Evolving Landscape of the Field: Some fields constantly evolve, with new technologies, social trends, or policy changes emerging. Research conducted even a few years ago might not reflect the current landscape. Consider a communication student researching the impact of social media on political participation might find a wealth of research on traditional platforms like Facebook and Twitter. However, the rise of newer platforms like TikTok necessitates investigating how these emerging technologies influence political engagement, particularly among younger demographics.

Remember, in this journey of exploration and refinement, each inconsistency in findings, unanswered question, and lack of research in specific areas unveils opportunities for impactful contributions. Embrace these challenges as gateways to novel insights, ensuring your research addresses critical gaps and advances the understanding of your chosen field.

If you need expert guidance to craft a robust problem statement without the time-consuming headache, don't hesitate to reach out for assistance.

## Page 26: The Best Dissertation is a Done Dissertation. (And How to Get There!) – DissertationPrep
URL: https://dissertationprep.com/blogs/blog/the-best-dissertation-is-a-done-dissertation-and-how-to-get-there
Date: 2023-04-25
Description: Common issues faced by graduate students when writing a dissertation are fear of failure, procrastination, lack of support, and perfectionism. To overcome these obstacles, focus on progress, establish a writing routine, seek support, and remember that failure is a natural part of the learning process.

_By Dani Babb, PhD_

As a graduate student, you may have heard the phrase "the best dissertation is a done dissertation". While this statement is true, it's easier said than done as you likely already know. Writing a dissertation is a daunting task that requires a significant amount of time, effort, and perseverance. In this article, I will take a closer look at some of the common issues that graduate students face when writing their dissertation and provide some strategies for overcoming them.

### Fear of Failure

Fear of failure is a common obstacle that many graduate students face when writing their dissertation. The pressure to produce a high-quality piece of work can lead to self-doubt and perfectionism. However, it's essential to remember that failure is a natural part of the learning process. No one produces a perfect dissertation on their first attempt. Learning from failure is how we grow and improve.

One way to overcome the fear of failure is to focus on progress, not perfection. Set small, achievable goals for yourself and celebrate your successes along the way. Keep in mind that your dissertation does not need to be perfect. Strive for excellence, but recognize that perfection is an unrealistic and unattainable goal. We also have coaches available to help over this mental hurdle as well. (((JOE link to contact us form until we have Nicole's stuff up)

### Procrastination

Procrastination is another common issue that many graduate students face when writing their dissertation. It can be challenging to motivate yourself to work on a long-term project with no immediate deadline. However, procrastination can quickly lead to a situation where you're running out of time and scrambling to finish your work before your deadline.

To overcome procrastination, it's essential to establish a regular writing routine. Set aside specific times each day or week to work on your dissertation and stick to them, even if it means sacrificing other activities in the short-term. Use tools such as timers, calendars, and to-do lists to help you stay organized and on track. Sometimes you'll also need to loop family and friends in on your plan. Personally, I found the best time to work on my doctoral study was when everyone else was out having a good time and I had a quiet house to myself (sad but true! I don't regret it!)

### Lack of Support

Writing a dissertation can be a lonely and isolating experience. Many graduate students report feeling unsupported by their peers, advisors, or department. However, it's crucial to remember that you are not alone. There are many resources available to support graduate students, such as writing centers, peer support groups, and online forums.

One way to overcome the lack of support is to seek out community and connection. Connect with other graduate students in your department or field, join a writing group or accountability group, or seek out a mentor or advisor who can provide guidance and support. Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. Join our Facebook group for students too if you like!

[Join our Facebook group!](https://www.facebook.com/groups/980763265876902)

### Perfectionism

Perfectionism is a common issue that many graduate students face when writing their dissertation. The desire to produce a high-quality piece of work can lead to an obsessive focus on details and an unwillingness to move forward. However, perfectionism can be a barrier to progress and can lead to writer's block and procrastination. When conducting data analysis, we often refer to this as analysis paralysis.

To overcome perfectionism, it's essential to set realistic goals for yourself and focus on making steady progress. Break your dissertation into smaller, more manageable tasks, and tackle them one at a time. Use tools such as outlines and drafts to help you organize your thoughts and ideas. Recognize that your dissertation does not need to be perfect and that it's okay to make mistakes.

Writing a dissertation is a challenging and often overwhelming task, but it's important to remember that the best dissertation is a done dissertation. To overcome the common obstacles that graduate students face when writing their dissertation, focus on progress, not perfection, establish a regular writing routine, seek out support and community, and recognize that failure is a natural part of the learning process.

Date: 2023-04-18
Description: This article explains the difference between theoretical and conceptual frameworks for students and mentors in the research process. A theoretical framework provides a broad set of principles, concepts, and assumptions that guide data collection, analysis, and interpretation. A conceptual framework is more specific.

_By Dani Babb, PhD_

One of the more frequently asked questions for our qualitative and quantitative methods experts is on the difference in theoretical and conceptual frameworks. The issue causes confusion for students, and sometimes mentors alike!

Both theoretical and conceptual frameworks are commonly used in dissertations to guide the research process and help structure the study, yet the elements are often confusing for students.

A theoretical framework is generally part of the introduction or literature review section of a dissertation. It provides an overview of the existing research on the topic and identifies the key concepts, theories, and models that will be used to analyze the data. The theoretical framework will explain the relationships between the variables and constructs that are relevant to the research question, and provide a basis for the hypotheses that will be tested in quantitative studies. Theoretical frameworks are often used in quantitative research to guide data collection, analysis, and interpretation. They can help researchers identify research gaps and formulate hypotheses.

A theoretical framework is approached as a broad set of principles, concepts, and assumptions that provide a systematic way of understanding and analyzing phenomena in a particular field of study.

Students may find that the theoretical framework consists of a set of interconnected concepts and theories that explain the relationships between variables or constructs.

On the other hand, a conceptual framework is usually included in the methodology or results section of a dissertation and is more specific - servicing ad a foundation for the study. It defines the key concepts and variables that will be used in the study, and outlines the relationships between them. The conceptual framework should explain how the study will be structured and how the data will be analyzed, and provide a basis for the conclusions and recommendations that will be drawn from the results.

Conceptual frameworks are often used in qualitative research to guide data collection, analysis, and interpretation. They help researchers develop a deeper understanding of the phenomena they are studying and generate new insights and perspectives.

In both cases, the framework serves as a roadmap for the research, helping to structure the study, guide the data collection and analysis, and provide a coherent and integrated account of the findings.

A theoretical framework provides a broader perspective and helps to guide research in a particular field, while a conceptual framework provides a more focused perspective and helps to guide a specific research study. If you need further assistance, we are glad to help you!

_By Dani Babb, PhD_

Qualitative dissertation research involves the collection and analysis of non-numerical data, such as interviews, observations, and open-ended survey responses. One of the key steps in qualitative research is to identify themes that emerge from the data you have collected. There are many different tools that researchers can use to analyze themes in qualitative research. In this blog, we'll explore some of the most popular and effective tools.

1. Coding: Coding is a widely used method for identifying themes in qualitative research. Researchers review the data collected and identify specific words or phrases that are relevant to the research question. Each word or phrase is then assigned a code, and these codes are grouped together to form themes. Coding can be done manually, or researchers can use specialized software, such as NVivo or ATLAS.ti, to help with the process.

1. Content analysis: Content analysis is another common method for analyzing themes in qualitative research. In this approach, researchers analyze the content of the data, looking for patterns and themes. This can involve identifying keywords and phrases that are used frequently, or analyzing the structure of the data to identify common themes. Content analysis can be done manually, or researchers can use specialized software, such as QDA Miner or MAXQDA, to help with the process.

1. Grounded theory: Grounded theory is a method for developing theories based on the data collected in qualitative research. In this approach, researchers identify concepts and relationships between them that emerge from the data. These concepts are then used to develop a theory or model that explains the phenomenon being studied. This approach requires careful analysis and interpretation of the data and can be time-consuming, but can be very powerful in generating new insights.

1. Thematic analysis: Thematic analysis is a flexible method for analyzing themes in qualitative research. In this approach, researchers review the data collected and identify patterns and themes. These themes are then organized into a hierarchical structure, with overarching themes and sub-themes. Thematic analysis can be done manually or using specialized software, such as Dedoose or Quirkos.

1. Narrative analysis: Narrative analysis is a method for analyzing the stories or narratives told by participants in qualitative research. Researchers look for recurring themes and patterns in the stories, and analyze the structure and content of the narratives to identify key themes. Narrative analysis can be done manually or using specialized software, such as Nvivo or MAXQDA.

1. Discourse analysis: Discourse analysis is a method for analyzing the use of language in qualitative data. Researchers look at how language is used to construct meaning, identify power dynamics, and reinforce or challenge social norms. This approach can be particularly useful in analyzing data related to social justice issues, such as race or gender. Discourse analysis can be done manually or using specialized software, such as Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC).

There are many different tools that researchers can use to analyze themes in qualitative dissertation research. The most appropriate tool will depend on the research question, the data collected, and the skills and expertise of the research team. By carefully analyzing the data and identifying key themes, researchers can develop new insights and advance our understanding of complex phenomena.

Description: When conducting research for your dissertation, it's important to choose the appropriate methodology to align with your research question and goals. The two most common methodologies are qualitative and quantitative research. We are here to help help you choose the appropriate methodology.

_By Dani Babb, PhD_

When conducting research for your dissertation, it's important to choose the appropriate methodology to align with your research question and goals. The two most common methodologies are qualitative and quantitative research. While they share some similarities, such as collecting data, they differ in their approaches to gathering and analyzing information. In this blog, we will explore the key differences between qualitative and quantitative research, and provide guidance on how to determine which methodology to use. Check out our infographic on the topic as well! (((Joe link to the infographic under resources)))

## Qualitative research

Qualitative research is a methodology that allows researchers to seek to understand human behavior, beliefs, opinions, and experiences through the collection and analysis of non-numerical data. This type of research typically involves open-ended questions and exploratory methods, such as interviews, focus groups, and observation. The purpose of qualitative research is to gain an in-depth understanding of the research topic and the factors that influence it.

## Qualitative research is particularly useful when:

- The research question is exploratory in nature: Qualitative research is best suited for exploring new ideas and concepts. When the research question is open-ended and exploratory, qualitative research is a nice choice.

- Understanding the human perspective is key: If the aim of the research is to gain an understanding of human behavior, beliefs, and experiences, then qualitative research is one way to go.

- Investigating complex issues: If the research topic is complex and requires a detailed understanding of the issues involved, then qualitative research can help to provide a deep insight into the subject matter.

## Quantitative research

Quantitative research is a methodology that involves the collection and analysis of numerical data. This type of research involves using structured methods, such as surveys or experiments, to gather data that can be analyzed statistically. The purpose of quantitative research is to quantify behaviors, opinions, and experiences and draw statistical conclusions.

## Quantitative research is particularly useful when:

- The research question requires a numerical answer: Quantitative research is suitable for answering research questions that require a numerical answer, such as "how many?" or "what percentage?".
- Testing hypotheses: If the aim of the researcher is to test a hypothesis or theory, then quantitative research is a good choice. This is because the numerical data collected can be analyzed statistically to test whether the hypothesis is to be rejected or not.
- Comparing groups: If the research requires comparing groups, such as two or more different treatments, then quantitative research is a good option.

## Which methodology to choose?

Choosing the appropriate methodology requires careful consideration of the research question, goals, and available resources. In general, qualitative research is useful for exploring new ideas and gaining an in-depth understanding of complex issues. On the other hand, quantitative research is useful for testing hypotheses and drawing statistical conclusions.

It's important to note that these two methodologies are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they can complement each other. A mixed-methods approach, which combines both qualitative and quantitative research, can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the research topic.

When deciding on which methodology to use, it is essential to consider the research question and the nature of the data required. Qualitative research is best for exploring new ideas and gaining an in-depth understanding of complex issues. Quantitative research is useful for testing hypotheses and drawing statistical conclusions. A mixed-methods approach can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the research topic. Ultimately, the choice of methodology will depend on the research question, goals, and available resources

Description: A compelling abstract is vital to your dissertation. An abstract should provide a concise and clear overview of the main points and arguments of your dissertation. We can assist you in writing your abstract through our coaching or editing services!

_By Dani Babb, PhD_

A compelling abstract is vital to your dissertation both for your internal document and publication. Many of my students have said the abstract is harder to write than the work itself! The abstract is a very brief overview of hundreds of pages of work and that conciseness, particularly after writing so verbose, can be challenging.​

​The purpose of an abstract is to provide a quick and clear overview of your dissertation, to give readers a sense of what to expect from the full document, and to make it easier for readers to decide whether to read your full research document.​ ​​The abstract will provide a brief summary of the dissertation's key elements and findings. An abstract is typically a short paragraph or two, and it is often the first part of the dissertation that readers will see.​ It's certainly what will populate first after you publish your work.​

An abstract should provide a concise and clear overview of the main points and arguments of your dissertation. It should give readers an idea of the scope and significance of the research, ​the depth, ​as well as the methods used and the results obtained. The abstract should highlight the most important findings or conclusions of the dissertation, and it should also give an indication of the implications of the research for the field of study.​ ​An abstract should also convey the tone and style of your research. It should be well-written and engaging, and it should give readers a sense of ​your expertise and enthusiasm for the topic.

The contents of an abstract for a dissertation may vary depending on ​your field of study and the specific requirements of the ​college you are attending. However, generally, an abstract should include the following elements:

Background and context: Briefly describe the background and context of the research question or problem that the dissertation addresses.

Purpose: Clearly state the main purpose or objective of the dissertation, and explain why this research is important or significant.

Methodology: Describe the research methodology or methods used to investigate the research question or problem, including the approach, data collection, and analysis.

Results: Summarize the main findings or results of the research, highlighting the most important or interesting findings.

Conclusion: Briefly discuss the implications of the research findings, and explain how the research contributes to the field of study.

Key terms: List any key terms or concepts that are central to the dissertation, and provide definitions if necessary.

Length and format: ​At some colleges, you will sSpecify the length and format of the dissertation, including the number of chapters, pages, and any appendices or supplementary materials​ in the abstract, though I see this only on occasion.​

Overall, the abstract should be a concise and clear summary of the dissertation that gives readers an idea of what the research is about, what the main findings are, and why the research is important or significant. ​We can assist you in writing your abstract through our coaching or editing services!​

## Page 32: ABD - Should Doctoral Candidates Use This Common Designation? – DissertationPrep
URL: https://dissertationprep.com/blogs/blog/abd-should-doctoral-candidates-use-this-common-designation
Date: 2023-02-28
Description: Many doctoral candidates use ABD on social media or a curriculum vitae. Whether or not a student should use the ABD designation is a matter of personal choice and career goals. If you are considering using the ABD designation, it is essential to understand how it may be perceived by others in your field.

_By Dani Babb, PhD_

Many doctoral candidates use ABD on social media or a [curriculum vitae](https://dissertationprep.com/products/cv-writing-for-candidates-and-graduates). ABD meana for "All But Dissertation," which indicates that a student has completed all the coursework and requirements for a doctoral degree, except for the dissertation. Some students use the ABD designation to indicate that they have completed all the requirements of their doctoral program except for the dissertation.

Whether or not a student should use the ABD designation is a matter of personal choice and career goals. Some people feel that it is an appropriate designation to use because it accurately reflects their progress in their doctoral program. Others argue that it is not appropriate to use ABD because it implies that the student has completed the program when, in fact, they have not completed the most significant aspect of the requirements.

If you are considering using the ABD designation, it is essential to understand how it may be perceived by others in your field. Some employers, colleagues, and academic institutions may view ABD as a negative or incomplete designation. Therefore, it is essential to weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of using the ABD designation before deciding whether or not to use it.

If a person who has completed all the requirements for a doctoral degree except for the dissertation does not want to use the ABD designation, they may consider using alternative language to describe their status. Here are a few options:

1. "Doctoral Candidate": This term is commonly used to describe a student who has completed all of their coursework and comprehensive exams and is working on their dissertation.

3. "Doctoral Candidate, Dissertation in Progress": This designation can indicate that a student has completed all the requirements for their doctoral degree except for the dissertation and is currently working on that final requirement.

5. "Doctoral Candidate, Defending Soon": This option can be used when a student is close to completing their dissertation and is preparing to defend it.

While these may be popular on social media, a better way to reflect it on a [cv](https://dissertationprep.com/products/cv-writing-for-candidates-and-graduates) is to put “expected completion date ABC. Completed…” and then indicate how many chapters you have finished or where you are in the process.

It's essential to consider the norms in your field and the context in which you will be using your designation. Some fields or academic institutions may have specific terms or conventions that are expected and usually ABD is not among them. Ultimately, the most important thing is to accurately and transparently convey your status and progress towards your degree! Finish that dissertation! We are here to help!

## Page 33: 7 Dissertation Writing Tips to Avoid Common Grammatical Mistakes – DissertationPrep
URL: https://dissertationprep.com/blogs/blog/7-dissertation-writing-tips-to-avoid-common-grammatical-mistakes
Date: 2023-02-21
Description: A doctoral dissertation gets rejected by committee members for many reasons. Oftentimes it’s not the content or the topic itself but the writing or writing style. We address dissertation writing tips and common grammatical mistakes to avoid to pass your work by your committee.

_By Dr. Klem_

Dissertation writing can be daunting and many students are fearful of the process. It is a different way of writing and thinking for this highest level of education a person can obtain. When a dissertation is not approved by your committee, the reason can be traced, usually, to the student’s failure to follow the official format guidelines of the school, to miss some APA formatting or to fail to fully edit the document – among other issues ( [such as alignment for example!](https://dissertationprep.com/blogs/blog/5-tips-to-fixing-alignment-in-a-dissertation-proposal-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work)) . I have compiled a list of the most common mistakes students make in formatting and submitting their dissertations to assist you!

1. “As shown in the Publication Manual 6th edition, the word datum is singular, and the word data is plural” (p. 96). Plural nouns take plural verbs, so data should be followed by a plural verb. Example: Each datum matches the location of an object to a coordinate on the map. Although we have compiled the results, these data are the focus of another report and are not described here. Try to practice this or scrub your own document for these potential issues!
2. The United States is abbreviated as U.S. only when used as an adjective: U.S. Navy, but in the United States. Use a period when abbreviating the United States as an adjective (U.S. Marines or U.S. Senator).
3. If you reference or quote a theory in the body of your work, include an in-text citation. This notes the author and year of the source in which the theory appears (Iida, 2021). One tip I like to give is to keep track of your citations as you read articles for your literature review or to look for a gap in research.
4. Eliminate first person (I, we, our, etc.) since you are not relating a personal experience. A personal experience requires a personal relationship. If you are relating a personal experience use “I or me.” However, if you are only giving a personal opinion do not use first person. Example - The researcher has worked with the population for 25 years. CORRECTION - I have worked with the population for 25 years. Or This researcher selected fifty participants. CORRECTION - Fifty participants were selected! Never use "this researcher, this learner,” etc. This is not proper grammar and is referred to as anthropomorphism or an anthropomorphic response (giving human like qualities to non-human things). A common example is “This study seeks to”. The study is not seeking, the researcher is! In a dissertation, only use first person in the "role of the researcher" section in chapter 4 of the dissertation unless your school states otherwise (and many do).
5. If the source has three or more authors you use the first author's last name and the words et al. (without italics) for every citation even the first (APA, 2020, p. 266). Here is an example, (Cummings et al., 2022). Do not list out all authors for your in-text citation. All authors will be listed in the reference page.
6. Spell out numbers one through nine that appear in the body text. Use Arabic numerals to express numbers 10 and above. (Iida, 2021).
7. Be sure to use the appropriate tense in your doctoral study! Your proposal will have what you will do in the future, and your completed manuscript will convert future tense to past tense. In addition, different sections of a dissertation use a different tense. The verb tenses commonly used in dissertation writing are present (simple present), simple past, present perfect, and future. Let’s review them so you can use them correctly.
1. present (simple present) – use words like examines, relates, presents, describes. These keep the writing in the present and tells the reader this is what this study will do. Commonly used in the abstract, summaries, introduction, conclusions or discussion, and theoretical framework sections of the dissertation.
2. simple past – use words like conducted, participants had, was used, are relevant to and shows a connection to the past research and the current research. These words discuss previous events. Is commonly used in the methods and results, conclusions or discussion, limitations,
3. present perfect – use words like conducted, investigated, has shown to demonstrate the connection between previous research and your research. These words and others show that the past research is still relevant to the current research. This is commonly used in the literature review (chapter 2 of the dissertation).
4. Future (modal auxiliary) – these words tell the reader what you, the researcher are suggesting for future research. Words like should conduct, may be, will likely are used to suggest future research. This is commonly used in the recommendations and implications section of the dissertation.

The best tense is usually suggested in the APA manual and by your school. Make sure to use the templates and guides provided by your school to master the tense your school would prefer for each section. You can read more about tenses here [https://www.scribbr.com/dissertation/tense-tendencies-in-theses-and-dissertations/](https://www.scribbr.com/dissertation/tense-tendencies-in-theses-and-dissertations/). Ensuring your work is free from errors before submission will help you get a clear pass from your committee. As always, our editing team remains available anytime to assist you as well!

## Page 34: Tips To Ace your Doctoral Dissertation Oral Defense – DissertationPrep
URL: https://dissertationprep.com/blogs/blog/tips-to-ace-your-doctoral-dissertation-oral-defense
Date: 2023-02-14
Description: Preparing for your doctoral dissertation oral dissertation defense can be a challenging. This is an opportunity for you to demonstrate the mastery of your research. In this article we talk about dissertation defense expectations, tips to ace your dissertation defense as well as common dissertation defense questions.

_By Nicole Dhanraj, Ph.D._

Preparing for your doctoral dissertation oral defense can be a challenging but exciting experience. It is exceptionally crucial that you are well prepared for your defense. This is the near-final step in your doctoral academic journey and in some cases, will determine if you finalize, earn and are awarded your doctoral degree!

The dissertation oral defense is an opportunity for you to demonstrate the mastery of your research topic, your understanding of the field, the scope of your research (including what is inside - and not inside, scope) and the ability to communicate your findings effectively to your Chair and committee members. In some cases, your defense will be recorded for others at the university to review as well so you should also get comfortable being on camera.

## Defense Expectations

During the dissertation defense, you will provide an overview of your study to demonstrate that you completed a significant piece of original research and that you deeply understand your topic. You will present a brief overview of your research, including the research question, methodology, results, and conclusion. Essentially, in the doctoral dissertation defense, you will walk the committee members and any attending guests through an overview of your five dissertation chapters. However, often in the final defense you are expected to focus primarily on Chapters 4 and 5 as Chapters 1 through 3 have already been addressed, most likely, in your proposal oral defense.

## Tips to Ace Your Defense

Here are some tips to help you successfully navigate and ace your doctoral dissertation oral defense:

Familiarize yourself with the requirements and format of your defense: Understand the specifics of your program's defense process, including what type of presentation you should prepare, how long it should be, the chapters or areas you should focus on and any questions you can expect. Keep in mind that questions are usually used to test your knowledge, ensure that you are the one who completed the work and address any concerns from the committee – as well as suggest any changes to the final presentation or manuscript. Many times you won’t know the questions ahead of time and while you may ask your chair, he or she may not be inclined to comment much about it.

Stay organized: Make sure your materials, including slides, handouts, and backup data, are organized and ready to present. Be familiar with presenting in presentation mode so that you are not fumbling through your slides. Make sure you practice with the tool your College uses to present! You don’t want to waste the first ten minutes testing microphones and learning how to share your slides.

Practice your presentation: Ensure you rehearse your defense multiple times with friends, peers, or faculty members. This will help you feel more confident, reduce the chances of forgetting essential points, and allow you to work out any kinks and refine areas that need improving. You want to ensure you are communicating effectively and smoothly. It is also a means to identify potential questions that could arise during your defense, although you can also expect questions on methodology that friends and family likely won’t be able to pinpoint. Practicing your presentation helps you become more familiar with your material, which can increase your confidence and reduce nervousness during the actual defense.

Be specific and clear: When presenting your findings, be confident and transparent in explaining the relationship between your research questions and your results. Your committee will look to see that you understand your work and how it contributes to the field. They will also expect that you know what you did not cover, and what the limitations and assumptions of your work are and how they impacted your study. If there was any potential bias, be prepared to talk about it.. Ensure you can address the underlying reasons if you fail to reach your target sample size and whether that impacted the final outcome or not.

Review your work thoroughly: Ensure you are familiar with every aspect of your research and be prepared to defend it. This includes understanding your research methods, results, biases, outcomes, limitations and conclusions. Review your work for spelling and content errors.

## Common Defense Questions

Prepare for questions: Anticipate potential questions from your committee and practice answering them. This will help you feel more comfortable and confident during the actual defense. Make sure you clearly understand what you want to learn through your research. You should be able to connect your findings to your research questions and explain how your results answer the questions you set out to answer and support your conclusions. Here are some common questions you may receive from your panel.

01. Walk us through your methodology and tell us why this methodology was appropriate for your study.
02. How do your findings compare to previous research in the field?
03. Can you discuss the limitations of your research and what future directions it suggests?
04. What happened as a result of the obtained sample size?
05. Is your work generalizable? If so, to what population? If not why?
06. Can you describe the process you used to analyze your data?
07. How did you address bias in your data analysis?
08. Can you discuss the potential future implications of your research?
09. How do you plan to disseminate your findings and make them accessible to others in the field?
10. Can you discuss the ethical considerations involved in your research and how you addressed them?
11. What were the limitations or gaps in the literature?
12. Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the research design you used.

## Handling Critiques and Questions

Handling questions raised by the panel during a doctoral dissertation oral defense can be challenging, but some strategies can help you prepare and respond effectively:

Listen carefully: When a panel member asks a question, listen carefully to understand what they are requesting before responding. Take a moment to gather your thoughts and formulate a clear and concise answer.

Be honest: If you don't know the answer to a question, it's okay to admit it. You can also offer to follow up with more information after the defense.

Be prepared: Anticipate the types of questions that may be asked and be ready to provide thoughtful and well-reasoned answers.

Stay calm: Remember that your defense is an opportunity to showcase your hard work and demonstrate mastery of your topic. Stay calm and confident, and be open to constructive criticism. Do your best to answer the questions, and you can state that you do not know the answer to a question if you do not (that is far better than guessing your way through and being incorrect!).

Clarify: If you're unsure what a panel member is asking, don't hesitate to ask for clarification. This shows that you're engaged and invested in the defense process. If you are not understanding the question, just say so. If the question being asked is outside the scope of your research, say so! Rememeber the goal is to show that you know every aspect of your study!

Provide examples: If possible, provide concrete examples to support your answers and help illustrate your points.

Keep your answers focused: When answering questions, keep your responses focused and avoid getting sidetracked. Stay on point and use your time effectively.

## Importance of being prepared and confident

Remember that your doctoral dissertation oral defense culminates in years of hard work and dedication. By preparing thoroughly, you can increase the chances a successful outcome and take a significant step towards earning your doctoral degree. By preparing this way, you will be able to effectively communicate the relationship between your research questions, findings, and the literature review, demonstrating your mastery of the topic and ability to contribute to the field, and no doubt finish with your degree in hand!

_By Nicole Dhanraj, PhD_

The dissertation or doctoral study experience is unlike any other academic experience. Perhaps you are a rockstar student, aced your projects and assignments, and finished your previous degrees satisfactorily. Maybe you spent some sleepless nights, missed some life events, and had some stress, but overall, you got your degree done.

When it comes to the doctoral coursework, especially dissertation writing, this writing experience tests every philosophy of education (and perhaps life!) you have. It is truly the turning point of moving from a student to a scholar. It can be described as a subconscious hazing process to some.

Often students lose their momentum and get stuck in the all but dissertation phase because not only does the dissertation create and cause stress for so many students, but the overall process can be confusing and frustrating.

The expectation versus reality of writing a dissertation is often the polar opposite. After all, you know how to write and conduct research…but there is something different about this process that is challenging. You have different expectations, a different level of scholarly work, and an entire committee to please.

## Dissertation Writing Help

The following are some tips to prepare you for this life-changing doctoral writing experience to reduce your stress and frustration.

Evaluate your life.

It would help if you examined your responsibilities as a working professional, parent, son/daughter, and so forth before starting your dissertation. Research and writing consume significant time. If you want to finish promptly, your dissertation should be a priority. If you have multiple areas competing for your time, you are more than likely to sacrifice your dissertation time for life events. This suffocating feeling of having no time for your dissertation adds further stress, especially when financing your degree and paying tuition every quarter, whether you made progress or not.

Prepare your family.

Your family may feel left out when you are nose-deep in research or need quiet writing space. This feeling can cause familial conflict. You will need to prepare them for life as a doctoral student. This preparation may include passing off responsibilities or soliciting help to maintain your household. Don’t pinch on paying for help as well. You may end up paying tuition instead. Discussing your needs and this new phase of your life and getting their buy-in is crucial to your success.

Write your purpose.

When your proposal gets rejected, your mentor asks for another edit, or you struggle to refine your topic, you will question why you in pursuing this doctoral degree. You may think about giving up. You may be ready to throw the towel in at the 99th mile in the proverbial 100-mile race. Sometimes, though the end is within, students give up. However, you will have the motivation and strength to continue when your purpose is in full view. Returning to your personal “why” will keep you going and energize you when needed. Also, remember that there is no guilt and shame in deciding not to finish the degree. Nothing is ever wasted. You are not any less intelligent, a quitter, or not motivated. We all have to reevaluate our choices from time to time, and sometimes we recognize what we thought was a good idea and benefits may not be the most optimal choice. Wherever you leave off, you will have gained knowledge and lessons and can leverage that. However, persevering will bring incredible rewards – both obvious and not so apparent.

Find cheerleaders.

You will have your Chair, committee members, and other help from the University you are attending. However, you will need to have a support team. These people you can confide in and share your feelings with. Your tank is likely to be emptied now and again throughout this doctoral journey. Therefore, your support team is critical for navigating the swirl of emotions the dissertation process will take you through. Your support team can lend a listening ear, be someone to vent your frustrations to, or help you brainstorm ideas. Get dissertation help to support you mentally and emotionally as well. Joining a free support group like ours also help you to be amongst like-minded folks willing to cheer you on!

Continue learning outside of your doctoral program

Start using various resources to learn more about writing and research as you work on your class requirements. Dissect the dissertation process and learn about each part and what is needed to be successful in these areas. Use university resources to learn how to perform a literature review. Watch videos to learn more about your methodology. Join free groups to connect with other students so you can learn, share ideas, and ask questions.

Choose your research topic early

Clarifying your topic early in the game will save you some frustration and a complete do-over in the worst-case scenario! That can be defeating and make you want to quit, so do your best to understand what you want to study early-- and ensure there is a gap in the literature! Do not wait till you are ready to write.

Time management.

Be prepared for a lesson in time management. Whether you are already stellar at managing your time or not so efficient, you will take those skills a couple of notches up! You will learn to prioritize significantly, especially as deadlines and the tuition invoice are due. One primary practice you can implement is committing to some work each day. Set aside a time that works for you. This period could be 15 minutes, an hour, or just any block of time. Do not schedule something else on top of this time – it is valuable and important! If you work great under pressure, you may not need to do this, but sticking to a schedule forces you to keep your momentum.

Select an optimal environment.

It will help if you maximize the time spent when working. Ensuring you have a suitable desk, chair, lighting, computer, and other tools will make the process easier and more enjoyable. I mean, even plants need an optimal environment to thrive, right? You are no different! You can consider changing your environment. Try the coffee shop, the library, office, or campus. Avoid spaces where you may get too comfortable, like the bedroom. Nothing is more enticing than a warm comfy bed to keep you from writing!

Timing is key!

Do you know when you are most productive? Are you an early bird or a night owl? Knowing the times and the space where you are most productive will help you maximize time.

Must have tools. Have the right tools. Invest in a good computer, software, chair, and desk. You will be using these items a lot. Have bookmarks ready for the library and school resources. You want to avoid being frustrated with manual processes, slow systems, and furniture that make your body ache. You will be at this for a while, so invest in the items that will make the process easier. You will have a return on your health and your sanity!

These recommendations will help you get started on this wild doctoral journey. We would love to help you move from ABD to Doctor!

Date: 2023-02-07
Description: Here are the Top 5 things dissertations chairs will not do that frustrates students. I have found that many students have a misconception about these rules of engagement and doctoral mentors. Being aware of the aforementioned tips ahead of time can help you tremendously!

_By Dani Babb, PhD_

Many doctoral students have an inaccurate picture of the role of their dissertation committee chair. These misconceptions will usually be straightened out within a short period after they start working with their chair. However, it’s best to be clear about them up-front to not lose time and to avoid awkward scenarios. Here are the Top 5 things I find that dissertations chairs will not do that frustrates students due to misconceptions from the get-go!

## 1\. Tell you how to conduct your research.

Remember, this is YOUR research. If you are expecting your chair to hold your hand throughout the process, you will be quickly disappointed. You can consider your chair to be a confidant, guide, counselor, and likely even a friend, but it is ultimately your journey. You will likely feel alone at various times, but this is normal. Your chair can’t be available 24/7. Many chairs are not employed full time for dissertation work, which is much more time consuming than teaching. When you receive your diploma, only your name will be at the center.

## 2\. Edit your file!

Many doctoral students struggle with using the proper tone in their writing, APA formatting, and even paragraph composition. While your chair can point out such issues in general terms, the chair is not an editor. Therefore, you are expected to address these issues separately, usually with the assistance of writing resources provided by the university (which, unfortunately, are often inadequate or stretched too thin) or with a paid editor (this is the preferred approach). [Consider using an external editor like those we offer](https://dissertationprep.com/products/editing-and-apa-service), or others!

## 3\. Allow you to run the show.

Some doctoral students believe they can dictate the terms of the relationship with their chair, as if the chair is an employee of the student. It is never a good idea for a student to approach the relationship in this manner, as most chairs would take offense to it. Committee chairs are experienced academics who, in most cases, have served on dozens (sometimes hundreds like your team here!) of doctoral committees. It is best to defer to their expertise when it comes to the rules of engagement. However, you are certainly free to share your preferences and limitations.

## 4\. Accept rapid-fire revisions

Nothing is more frustrating to a chair than to immediately receive a revised document from his or her mentee very shortly after spending significant time explaining concepts and/or extensively editing the document, because it is taken to mean that the student did not put forth the needed effort to absorb the information and make informed changes. As a chair, myself, most of the time I find that students do not even make the changes that I’ve suggested. In these cases, a chair is may take more time to return a revision in order to force the issue. Dissertation chairs expect that you will work with an editor or thoroughly understand the changes and even keep a change log to show what you’ve done to address their concerns.

## 5\. Work with you during periods of non-enrollment

During the dissertation journey, there will be various breaks in the process. These could be part of the university’s academic calendar or due to a decision taken by the student to not enroll for a particular term. The latter can happen when the student feels that enrollment during the term would not be fruitful (e.g., during the data collection phase), so it would be best to not pay tuition during this time. Whatever the reason may be, the student should be clear that no guidance can be given by the chair during such times. Therefore, the decision to take a semester off should not be taken lightly and students should not expect their chairperson or committee members to respond to their work or read their work, unless they volunteer or offer themselves. Dissertation chairs are often paid incredibly low to begin with, and nothing if you are not enrolled.

While some of these realities may seem harsh when first reading them, I have found that many students have a misconception about these rules of engagement and doctoral mentors discuss these issues in committee meetings amongst themselves. Most of us consider being a committee chairperson charity work. We will read thousands and thousands of pages of pages per student for very little pay. Most of us do this to give back because others did it before us — and we enjoy it. Being aware of the aforementioned tips ahead of time can help you tremendously!

## Page 37: 5 Tips To Fixing Alignment in a Dissertation Proposal: What Is It and – DissertationPrep
URL: https://dissertationprep.com/blogs/blog/5-tips-to-fixing-alignment-in-a-dissertation-proposal-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work
Date: 2023-01-31
Description: One of the most common reasons your dissertation may be sent back to you is for “alignment”. Alignment is important in your research. There are specific ways to check for alignment and arrive directly at the answers to your research in all research methodologies: quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods.

_By Mary Dereshiwsky, PhD_

One of the most common reasons your dissertation may be sent back to you is for “alignment”. You may hear this repeatedly.. “your dissertation is not in alignment.” “Your problem statement and purpose are not in alignment.” It seems to be an endless battle! If you’ve ever put together a jigsaw puzzle, you know that feeling of accomplishment when all the pieces fit together perfectly so that you can see the big picture. This is also the idea behind alignment of the key components of a dissertation proposal.

Why is alignment important in research? When research components fit together, you can arrive more directly at the answers to your research questions. Your readers can follow along with you, step by step, to see what you studied, why and how, to get those answers.

Here are some specific ways to check for alignment in your dissertation proposal:

Tip 1: Does the purpose of your study map tightly to your preceding problem statement? The problem is where you point out a current need, gap, or lack of information. Someone needs to know something. But they don’t yet have the necessary information to solve a problem or answer a question. Your study purpose identifies what you will do or look at to solve this problem. It is the driving-force curiosity itself that you will research. If you have thought through the nature of the problem very specifically, the purpose should flow directly from it. If there is a shortage of literature in a specific topic area, your purpose should state how you will fill that shortage.

Tip 2: Does the literature synthesize “what we (think we) know so far” about your key concepts of focus? Be careful of accidentally meandering down rabbit holes when you search the literature. If your study purpose has to do with motivation, don’t accidentally get derailed into interesting but irrelevant literature on satisfaction. The internet has made it possible to access tons of information in a split second. This is helpful if you stay on track in specifying exactly the concepts you will be investigating when you search the literature. On the other hand, if you get distracted by literature that doesn’t directly map to your key concepts, your literature review won’t match the goals of your own study.

Tip 3: Does the ‘how’ of your study align with ‘what’ you want to research? Another term for ‘how’ in research is methodology and design. Let’s consider methodology as a first step. There are only three types of research methodologies: quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods. Think of them as three trees in the forest. Every tree has branches emanating from it. Those branches will be the research designs aligned with each methodology. Will your study consist of data in numbers? If so, you want a quantitative methodology. Or will your data be in the form of words? If so, qualitative methodology aligns best with your research study goals. If you are planning to collect data in both numbers and words, you will have a mixed-methods methodology.

Tip 4: Next, does your curiosity (as contained with your study purpose) match to the best research design? If you are ‘identifying/what is/what are’ something(s), you have a descriptive design. If you are instead looking at relationships, associations, or predictions, you have a correlational design. Interested in determining what causes what? Your research will match the experimental design family. Or are you only looking at between-group differences on something? If so, you have a causal-comparative (also known as ex post facto) design. What about qualitative studies? If your intent is to capture your subjects’ lived experience in rich detail, your study aligns with a phenomenological design. Or you may instead be gathering and analyzing multiple forms of evidence on a ‘case’ (however you have defined it), which means you have a case study. Maybe instead you are immersed in a setting or situation and want to investigate that setting and subjects in depth. This means you have an ethnographic design. These are just a few possible examples of how to map your study goals to a related specific research design.

Tip 5: Finally, do the tools of your (analysis) trade match your research goals? For quantitative studies, you want to ensure that the statistic you compute to test your hypotheses matches the study goals. A detailed discussion of this topic is beyond the scope of this blog. For now, I’ll highlight just a few. If you are looking at relationships between pairs of variables, you will want some form of a correlation coefficient. If your goal is to predict something from something(s), you will likely want to apply regression analysis. Between-group mean differences suggest some form of the t-test or analysis of variance (ANOVA). Again, this only scratches the surface of how to pick the best-fitting statistic for the goals of your study. It is important to ensure that the statistical method fits the questions you are trying to answer and the related hypotheses you are trying to test, as well as the scales of measure of your variables.

Keeping the above components of your research proposal in alignment will help ensure that you reach your goal of answering the question(s) you started with in your research study. This will also make the results of your study useful to readers who also have an interest in your research topic. They will be able to follow your train of thought and how you arrived at your answers. They can then decide on any actions to take related to your study: for example, applying your findings directly to their own professional situations. Or they can continue to help build knowledge in this topic area by designing and implementing their own follow-up study. Either way, you are being a contributing responsible citizen of the wider research community by sharing what you learned in a way that others can apply.

Description: How to get through your dissertation, faster and quicker. Some schools offer editing services but often these editors are spread thin. Our Doctoral mentors can help you avoid pitfalls. You can work with one of our qualitative or quantitative coaches to help you learn.

_By Dani Babb, PhD_

“I want to go slow with my dissertation so I can waste time and money” – No one ever

In all of my years of teaching doctoral learners and guiding them through their dissertation process, I have literally never heard “I’d like this to take a while and max out my student loans.” (or anything remotely like this). Often times, the most eager learners ask me how they can get done with their dissertation in a year or less (extremely difficult if not impossible) or “what’s the fastest time I can be done in?” Of course the answer to this is always “it depends”.. but.. on what? The quick answers to that (to be expanded on in another blog) are things like: “how much time will you spend on your work”? “How supportive is your family”? “What other obligations or activities are you willing to give up”? “How well do you know how to conduct research”? “How good of a writer are you”? And many more…

For now though, I will focus on five things you can do before you begin your work (or while you are waiting for feedback from your committee or reviewers) to help save time and money – and get you through your dissertation faster.

## Tip 1: Get your participants ready ahead of time

Whether you are conducting a quantitative, qualitative or mixed methods study, you will need participants. You may choose a convenience sample (and pay a company like SurveyMonkey to send your survey out) and therefore this may not apply to you. But if you are interviewing, conducting a sample perhaps for a DBA degree within your organization or some other study that requires you get the attention of participants to answer your survey or study questions, you may want to start connecting now. Although you are not allowed to begin data collection until after receiving IRB approval, this does not mean that you cannot commence preparatory steps so to hit the ground running immediately after receiving IRB approval. Remain in periodic contact with your participant group, or at least the leaders of the organization who will be making the participants available. Of all the usual sources of delay, difficulty in securing participants is at or near the top.

## Tip 2: Identify an external mentor and editor to work with early in the process

Many of my students tell me when we begin working together that they are incredible, stellar writers and have mastered APA 7. Most of these students need editors at some point in their work. Some schools offer editing services which is terrific, but often these editors are spread thin and your committee may continually return your work for “grammar, APA and/or writing issues”. If you are really adamant about finishing quickly, you should not be relying solely on your committee members and the resources provided by the university, as these are insufficient for some students and can often have 2+ week waiting times in queues (think of the tuition you will be paying while you literally just wait). Consider an outside editor. [We have hourly editors available for you!](https://dissertationprep.com/products/editing-and-apa-service) Most of the time, entire dissertations take us 10-15 hours to edit and could save you thousands or more in tuition. You also need a personal support group to work with, which may include an outside resource who has worked with hundreds (or more) students in their time as doctoral mentors and can help you avoid pitfalls. You may also need a statistical or qualitative methods consultant. [(We have these experts too!](https://dissertationprep.com/pages/meet-the-coaches) I literally created these services because I see so many students need this added support.) Network with others in dissertation groups ( [yes we have a free support group as well!](https://www.facebook.com/groups/dissertationprepinc))

## Tip 3: Become familiar with data analysis software

Whether you’re using a quantitative approach with the help of a software tool like Excel (coupled with the data analysis tool pack), SPSS, or a qualitative approach with NVivo or similar, you should not wait to learn the software until it’s time to actually use it. Hopefully you have taken a class (or three) in the topic, but if you haven’t, there are plenty of tutorials online or you can work with one of our [qualitative or quantitative coaches](https://dissertationprep.com/pages/meet-the-coaches) to help you learn. Become familiar with tools early so you can go through the learning curve during a time in the process that is not critical. There are plenty of tutorials out there. Use bogus data to really understand how the program works in terms of helping you to analyze the data.

## Tip 4: Keep the research scope tight

[Read my article on 5 myths to know before you begin your dissertation process.](https://dissertationprep.com/blogs/blog/exposing-5-dissertation-myths-before-you-begin-your-doctoral-study-plus-a-freebie) I talk about scope of research in this article. As the old adage says, “the only good dissertation is a completed dissertation”. Logically, it’s much easier and quicker to complete a dissertation that has a small scope than it is to complete one that includes many diverse participants, locations, etc. Try to limit the scope of your dissertation as much as possible, while maintaining the integrity of your research. You can always expand on it later…after you graduate.

## Tip 5: Limit push back on committee feedback

There are surely going to be many occasions when you will not agree with feedback you are provided by a committee member. You may be correct. However, even if you strongly believe you are in the right, it’s usually wiser (meaning you will get through faster) to accept the feedback and make the needed changes in order to appease the committee member – particularly if this individual is a reviewer for the school. By the time the reviewer receives the work, it could be 4 to 6 weeks of other approvals so each time you fight the almost-inevitable, you add another (likely) 4 to 6 weeks in your process. At the end of the day, you need each committee member’s approval in order to move forward. Of course, always ask for clarification if you are unsure about what is being asked of you or the committee member just truly is not understanding something, but avoid pushing back and creating a rift because, chances are, you will just end up wasting time and eventually you may have to concede anyway.

Date: 2023-01-16
Description: There are many false beliefs about online doctoral programs and the universities that run them (i.e., universities that offer doctoral degrees). In this post are 5 Misconceptions from my 20 plus years of experience.

_By Dani Babb, PhD_

There are many false beliefs about online doctoral programs and the universities that run them (i.e., universities that offer doctoral degrees). Here’s my list of the Top 5 Misconceptions from over 20 years experience teaching in them:

## 1. They want to keep you enrolled as long as possible in order to earn as much tuition money from you as possible.

Admittedly, there used to be some truth to this. As with any profit-making venture, it makes good business sense to retain existing customers (in this case, paying students). It used to be quite common for students to feel that they are running in circles and are unlikely to ever step foot on the graduation stage. However, regulators seriously cracked down on this practice by ensuring that strict time-to-graduation metrics are upheld. Nowadays, most universities genuinely celebrate the graduation of their students. Of course, there are also business reasons behind showcasing this success to current and prospective students.  This is one reason your own committee may be in favor of you working with a coach or suggest an editor!

## 2. Most professors are working for the university full-time.

The ideal for any university is to have the majority of their professors be employed full-time so that they can properly engage with various aspects, such as curriculum development and alumni relations. However, the reality is that it is not economically feasible for online doctoral universities to maintain a high ratio of full-time faculty. Therefore, these universities tend to mostly employ part-time or adjunct faculty in order to allow the flexibility to accommodate periods of low and of high enrollment. Perhaps a crude way to characterize these faculty is as seasonal workers, and this is not far from the truth. As to be expected, these contracted workers tend to not be fully engaged with a university because they have the need to generate income from other sources (in most cases, they work for multiple universities). Prior to selecting a university to attend, a wise prospective student should determine the university’s ratio of full-time to part-time faculty (this data should be freely made accessible upon inquiry).

## 3. A doctoral degree from an online program does not have as much value as a doctoral degree from a traditional university.

As with all universities, there are those that are considered “prestigious”, and others that vary in terms of how they are perceived by the general public and, more importantly, by employers. While you will not find a purely online doctoral university among the top echelon of all universities, there are many that produce graduates who are just as capable and respected by their counterparts. While it can certainly be argued that the stigma related to the online variety of university still exists to a degree, this is dissipating with time as the online modality is gaining more acceptance (this was actually a positive byproduct of the COVID-19 pandemic). In fact, you would be hard-pressed to find a university today that does not offer at least some online courses. In short, if a university appears to offer you everything you’re looking for, don’t disregard it because it happens to be purely online.

## 4. They are owned and run by academics.

In most cases, these universities are owned and managed by businesspeople…entrepreneurs and large education conglomerates. In other words, they are businesses that happen to be providing education as a service. Is this a bad thing? Not necessarily. Keep in mind that all universities must receive accreditation from one of the major accrediting bodies in order to be able to disperse federal education loans (which is the way most students use to pay for their tuition). These accreditors try to ensure that universities are upholding standards that relate to aspects such as academic rigor, sound processes, equity, and accessibility. In other words, a university will not succeed if it is run strictly as a profit-making entity. However, any student or faculty member of an online university will clearly sense, at least from time to time, the business realities with which their institution is dealing.

## 5. Online universities are a relatively new undertaking.

The reality is that distance-based education (although not the “online” variety) has existed for many decades and I taught in the first one in the 1990s. Step back further in time to “correspondence” learning, where during high school I took college classes. Even further back - Imagine a time when most people did not live in or around large cities, but rather in villages that were often located quite a distance from the cities that housed university buildings.

While it was possible for some young people to leave home to move closer to these universities, it was not an option for everyone. For those who could not, they sometimes had the option of pursuing their education by corresponding with university faculty and administrators from their homes. Specifically, students would be shipped learning materials and requirements using a courier. These students would proceed to study and complete the required schoolwork, and then ship the materials back to the university for evaluation. This certainly resembles today’s online learning environment, minus the technology and timeliness!

In short, while online doctoral degree programs and universities, do not hold the prestige of Harvard, there are many outstanding, solid universities tou can attend today to earn your doctoral degree.

## Page 40: 5 Things to Avoid Saying to a Doctoral Student if You Want to Support – DissertationPrep
URL: https://dissertationprep.com/blogs/blog/5-things-to-avoid-saying-to-a-doctoral-student-if-you-want-to-support-their-work
Date: 2023-01-10
Description: The decision to pursue a doctoral degree is one of the most important decisions in a doctoral student's life. To support their work, there are things to avoid saying. Practical advice is not always helpful. Helping students get through their coursework and doctoral dissertation study is crucial for success.

_By Dani Babb, PhD_

For most, the decision to pursue a doctoral degree is one of the most important ones in their lives. Students undertake academic pursuits of the highest scholarship and potentially the most life changing. It’s also incredibly time consuming - and will require patience from friends and family. Therefore, encouragement and understanding from those closest to learners is paramount to our confidence and ultimate success.

However, some well-meaning individuals within this personal entourage may inadvertently say the wrong thing to students - who are likely already suffering from confidence issues or doubt regarding the pursuit of their degree.

Here are the Top 5 things to avoid saying to a doctoral student if you want to support their work:

## 1\. “Are you sure you can afford the tuition?”

Unless the doctoral student is independently wealthy, the chances are that he or she will need to borrow money or dig deeply into savings in order to pay for their tuition. They are probably already questioning the soundness of the financial investment they’re making. They don’t need to hear it from anyone else. If someone in your circle is questioning this element of the work, they may be coming from a practical perspective, but ultimately the choice to invest or not is yours. At some point it’s okay to say “I’ve thought this through and I choose to do it.” (I had to say this to my now ex-husband at the time too).

## 2\. “What good will a doctorate do you?”

While we all appreciate practical advice, sometimes it can be too practical. This is a difficult question for a doctoral student to answer, and any answer given may be met with skepticism. Although it usually impacts others, the decision to pursue a doctoral degree is ultimately a personal one. Respect the fact that the student is convinced, even if you may not have the same conviction. There are many reasons we choose to pursue a doctorate and not all of them will make financial sense to everyone in your circle.

## 3\. “It will be hard to not be able to spend as much time with your family.”

This is often the most difficult obstacle to overcome. There is no doubt that quality time with family and friends will be diminished throughout the doctoral journey. There is no way to sugarcoat this, and it’s not necessary to point it out because it’s not as if it has not already been a serious struggle by the student to come to terms with. Instead, focus on the student’s post-graduate life, by saying something like, “After you graduate, your family will be so proud of you!” This is uplifting and encouraging.

## 4\. “You just want to show off to the rest of us.”

Although this may be said in jest, there often is some underlying truth. While we may be genuinely happy for someone close to us who has decided to pursue a doctoral degree, our own inadequacies may surface, especially if we were not able to continue our own education and this has been a sore spot for us. Instead of taking the negative approach, use it as a source of inspiration for yourself. It’s never too late to go back to school.

## 5\. “Your grades in school were not that high, so are you sure you can handle it?”

Many doctoral degree learners were not top performers throughout their education. This should have no bearing on their ability to achieve success at the doctoral level. They are different people now, with families, jobs, and other responsibilities that have taught them to be dedicated to their duties. Even if they did not perform well in school earlier in their lives, help them to believe that this opportunity represents a clean slate.

If you find yourself surrounded by naysayers, it may be time to set some boundaries. More on this soon!

## Page 41: What to Do When Your Committee Members Disagree About Your Dissertatio – DissertationPrep
URL: https://dissertationprep.com/blogs/blog/what-to-do-when-your-committee-members-disagree-about-your-dissertation-work
Date: 2023-01-02
Description: Feedback you receive from a dissertation committee member should be clear and actionable. They may tell you what to do to help you through the remainder of the reviews and university review. However, this can frustrate some students. Hire us as coach and mentor to help you sort out the different thoughts and opinions.

_By Dani Babb, PhD_

In a perfect world (in other words, one in which you are not working on your dissertation!), any feedback you receive from a committee member should be clear and actionable. Your committee member would tell you what to do and how to fix any issues to help you through the remainder of the reviews and university review. However, that isn’t the purpose of doctoral dissertation work, and this can frustrate some students – especially coming from a master’s program where the feedback may be more specific (and not in disagreement with other faculty!)

Further, because all committee members are to be working from the same guidelines, students often think there should be no subjectivity to a review. However, this is often not the case. Just as judges in court can have their own biases, leanings, and personal philosophies that seep into their decisions, so, too, can committee members. Often times this leaves the student confused, not sure which direction to take or who’s path to follow in making revisions.

Something along the lines of the following statement has been made to me by mentees hundreds of times over the years: “I was told by X that this was OK, so why is Y now telling me that it’s not?” Sorry to say, but this sort of inconsistency is inherent to the process. It is part of the scholarly process that, in the end, leads to the best possible study. It is the students job to navigate the opinions of more than one scholar (aka your committee members and/or research reviewers). At the end of the day, committee members are human and, thus, are imperfect. When you throw other factors into the mix such as mood and level of fatigue at the time of the review, then it can feel like a crapshoot to the learner. As long as this reality is understood and accepted, it will greatly ease the process. You will be able to calmly identify when to inquire further, when to ask for advice, or even whether or not to ask for a call with everyone on at the same time to nail down the final recommendations and changes to make. Or of course – when to hire a coach (like us) to help you sort out the different thoughts and opinions.

A key piece of advice that I often provide to my mentees is to not push back on a committee member’s review, no matter how illogical or inconsistent it may appear; just make the requested changes, even if it seems that it contradicts what was previously indicated. Remember, you’re there to reach graduation as quickly as possible, not debate for the next three semesters over a few sentences. Committee members are like guards at toll booths along the journey; if you don’t pay the toll, you’re not allowed to continue on your way.

## Some ways you can respond to different or differing committee member feedback:

1. Accept the changes and move on
2. Ask your mentor for a call with all parties to iron out the differences in opinion and come to a consensus
3. Keep a change log! (This is important anyway) which can show your committee that the changes they are requesting now are (perhaps) completely different than in the past (that doesn’t mean he/she will change their minds though)
4. Ask the committee member for clarity and then ask your chair if he/she agrees with the recommendations

Sometimes, the inconsistencies aren’t within the committee at all, but a research reviewer. As one for universities, I can tell you that 1) not all committee members have fully read the work, 2) many of them are trying to just get you by as quickly as you are trying to get yourself by, 3) a change log helps me identify and compare my last requested changes to your current document as fast as possible and helps me feel comfortable you made the changes and 4) if you are confused, talk to your chair and/or get the reviewer on a call as well – and come into the call with a good attitude. As a reviewer, it is not fun to reject students work and we prefer to help learners move along.

The good news is that we’ve seen it all. We know exactly how to respond to committee member feedback in a way that softens the blow and allows you to quickly move past the current obstacle. Keep in mind that, after you graduate, there will be no more committee members to complicate your studies.

In fact, there will be no one standing in the way of your research but the institution you work for, colleagues and the IRB (for those of you that get the irony, yes! Dissertation work and studies mirror real life post-graduate research, which is exactly the point!). Just maintain focus on all that really matters at this stage of your educational journey, which is to graduate with a terminal degree that will hopefully open all kinds of doors for you.

I would like to end this article by clarifying that the majority of committee members are exceedingly helpful, consistent, and reasonable. I don’t want you to get the idea that this is necessarily what you will experience to a high degree. However, the chances are that there will be at least a couple reviews along the way that are head-scratchers for you. We will make sure you never feel that you’re stuck in the mud with your wheels spinning, but no forward progress is being made.

Description: Doctoral students have to learn the hard way in their dissertation work. Some have difficulty deciding between a quantitative or a qualitative approach. Our competent coaches can help you choose a methodology well aligned with your study to come up with a workable schedule and shave many months from your doctoral...

_By Dani Babb, PhD_

Jumping into your doctoral dissertation may seem relatively straight forward. Your chair is ready, you have an idea what topic you want to write about, and you have all the templates your school has provided to you. You begin to think through the more specific components of your topic and what will be less stressful. You ask your Chair for advice and you hear things like "the methodology will be driven by the research question", and other things that seem to not specifically answer your question. You begin to trudge along, with many things you believe and hold as constants. Unfortunately, these five things are often learned the hard way and regretted by doctoral learners!

## Myth 1: "I will have no problem finding participants for my study. I also have a lot of colleagues and friends who will reply!”

I can’t tell you how many of my mentees ran into the obstacle of not being able to secure enough participants for their data collection. In most cases, this was not a challenge they anticipated, even if they were warned about it during the proposal phase. Why the overconfidence? Well, I’ve found that it’s quite easy for potential respondents to agree to participate in the future. Sometimes this is called a convenience sample (who you know, not who is best to answer the study questions). However, when it comes time, realities arise. People have survey fatigue. Your study may not apply to all of your friends and colleagues, so they don't represent the population. Respondents become concerned about who will have the information, or their managers may not allow them to respond at all. There are many ways to mitigate this risk, including having a contingency plan in place. This is important to work through with a coach and to know what you will do if you do not hit that required sample size, whether quantitative, qualitative or mixed methods.

## Myth 2: "I think a mixed methods study or qualitative study is the way to go because I don't like statistics.”

Many students have difficulty deciding between a quantitative or a qualitative approach. These students may erroneously believe that it comes down to personal choice. For example, if they are turned off by math or statistics, then this is a sufficient reason to avoid the quantitative approach. Alternatively, they may want to incorporate both approaches in order to cover all bases - the mixed methods approach. This is overkill and, often, is tantamount to combining two studies into one. Even more importantly, the research question must drive your methodology or you will be out of alignment in your study results. If you want to undertake earth-shattering research after graduation, that is entirely a possibility. However, until then, take the path of least resistance. In this case, it would be selecting either a qualitative or a quantitative methodology, and letting the topic dictate which to go with (not your personal preference). Our coaches can help you choose a methodology well aligned with your study.

## Myth 3: "IRB won't have an issue with my study.”

It’s a toss-up whether the Institutional Review Board (IRB) or the IRS has caused more aggravation in my life as a doctoral mentor. I’m joking, of course, but this parallel should drive home the point that obtaining IRB approval should not be taken lightly. The basic role of the IRB is to ensure that research is conducted according to ethical standards and no harm is done to participants. As you might imagine, there is a lot of subjectivity that goes into the review. The reality is that only a small percentage of doctoral students pass the IRB phase after initial review. It's not uncommon to need two or three reviews - or more. If your University has a quick turn-around for these reviews, then it may not be that big of a deal. However, for many Universities, it can take up to one month to complete a single review. The last thing you want to do is to spend an entire term in the IRB phase. What a waste of time and money! We have IRB experts on our team to help you knock out IRB more quickly and pay less in tuition waiting for approvals. We can also help you decipher the change requests.

## Myth 4: "I plan to be done in less than two years.”

Most students want to get in, and then quickly out of their doctoral program. Almost all these students have an unrealistic perception of what it takes, or even of what true doctoral research is. Many go into the process mistakenly believing that they will be writing a white paper or heavy research paper not unlike their most stressful courses, or that they will be able to incorporate their extensive professional experiences. This is precisely what a doctoral study is not. Having an aggressive yet realistic timeline is likely to keep you on track and not lead to any discouragement along the way. Our coaches work with you to come up with a deliverable-based schedule that works for you.

## Myth 5: "I don't need extra help - I just need to follow the template."

As with most doctoral students, you likely don’t have unlimited resources. You also may be taking advantage of Federal student loans to help pay your tuition which will need to be paid back. The last thing you think you need is to spend out-of-pocket money on external support services. Most students don’t realize that this is actually money well-spent because, when it’s all said and done, it is likely to result in significant savings. Just do the math. If working with an experienced and competent external coach and/or editor can shave even a conservative six months from your doctoral journey, what is that worth to you? The chances are that whatever you pay would end up being much less than what you would have otherwise paid had you undertaken the journey on your own. We will work with you to cut down on time and save you tuition so you can get back to your other dreams and ambitions with your doctoral degree- done and complete!

NEWPORT BEACH, Calif., July 5, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Dani Babb, PhD today announced Dissertation Prep, a new service for doctoral students working on their dissertations. The dissertation solution is focused on helping learners move through the arduous process of a dissertation proposal or final manuscript, including coaching, mentoring, support, quantitative and qualitative analysis, statistics, writing and editing. Mentors have decades of experience coaching doctoral candidates, meeting them where they are at in their scholarly journey and guiding them to the next milestone.

"Schools want to provide the best resources for doctoral students but not every learner comes into a doctoral program with the same level of expertise – or time management – to be successful. This leaves many students struggling years into their dissertation work with limited resources and mounting tuition bills. We bridge the gap between college services and what students need, and help move students from 'stuck', to 'un-stuck'" says Dani Babb, PhD, Founder and Research Professor at Dissertation Prep. Mary Dereshiwsky, PhD, both an experienced doctoral mentor and statistician, joined the team as she saw more and more students unable to cross the All But Dissertation (ABD) milestone while needing help navigating the process or understanding what to do. "This service is essential for students who are struggling to complete their dissertations - or who are just beginning and want to move quickly. Students are often confused by methodology and navigating the committee process. We commit to helping doctoral students through those struggles, and more."

Features and benefits of the doctoral student solutions include:

- One-on-one mentoring and coaching with experienced qualitative, quantitative and writing experts
- Ongoing group support throughout the entire dissertation phase of studies
- Tailored milestones and objectives based on where students are – and where they need to be to complete their degrees
- Mentors with decades of experience coaching and mentoring students at a multitude of institutions.

The services are available for students and colleges immediately. The company offers institutional packages for colleges and universities interested in mentoring or writing services for their students who are struggling to complete their programs as a supplemental support service. "This is a win-win, says Babb. Students will experience success and colleges will improve their graduation rates with equipped graduates. Our team couldn't be happier to bring this to market." For more information on doctoral dissertation services, visit [www.dissertationprep.com](http://www.dissertationprep.com/)

**About Dissertation Prep:** Student-centered doctoral dissertation services to help learners move from doctoral candidates to doctoral graduates. Providing mentoring, guidance, support, writing and editing services for dissertation proposals and manuscripts. The experienced team of doctoral mentors and editors is ready to serve students looking for more help, and colleges wanting to offer additional support for their doctoral students.

_By Dani Babb, PhD_

Over the years, my doctoral students have gone into dissertation studies or doctoral work with many myths about the dissertation process. I started Dissertation Prep to help students get UNstuck and move from the dreaded All But Dissertation (ABD) to Doctor; Candidate to Graduate! Even as a dissertation coach and mentor, I see these myths persist. I’ll share each of them here with fact and fiction!

## \#1: Your Dissertation Needs to Solve a Huge Problem.

Fact: Your Doctoral Study Does Not Need to Solve World Hunger.

In fact quite the contrary. You need to offer a contribution to the academic body of literature. You can do this by finding a gap in existing literature, or if your college allows (as is often the case with professional degrees, like a DBA), finding a real world problem to use the scientific process to study. Even experienced researchers are often published by validating, re-validating or re-testing existing theories or beliefs. If you have a documentable reason that some outcome warrants a re-visit, by all means run this by your mentor. You need a narrow, specific problem.

## \#2: Your Dissertation Problem Statement Needs to be Broad Enough that it Can Be Applied Universally.

Fact: Your Dissertation Problem Statement Needs to be Narrow and Specific.

This is not only a myth but it could put your entire study at risk. A problem statement too broad has no credibility, isn’t “testable”, and remember – you are not trying to solve huge problems! You are demonstrating your ability to add to the body of knowledge and that you understand the concepts and practice of research.

Let’s look at one example. “Alternate Hypothesis: IT workers do not need to work overtime.” You can see how this problem is broad and difficult to study. Who will you question? Who will you interview? What is defined as overtime? Is this nationally or globally? What about companies that define 32 hours as full time? What types of businesses?

Now try this: “Alternate Hypothesis: IT workers in small sized rural healthcare facilities in Michigan work on average more than 40 hours per week.” Do you see how the second alternative hypothesis (what you believe to be true) is testable and “doable”? The first one can almost certainly not be measured and will lead to misalignment in your study.

The more specific you are, the better your outcomes and chances of success.

## \#3: Your Dissertation Will be Published and Read by The Entire Scholarly Community.

Fact: Your Dissertation Will be Read by your Committee; Maybe Members of the College; Likely Not Anyone Else

Why does this matter? Writers are always told to keep their audience in mind when writing. A dissertation is no exception. Yes your work will likely be “published” by a dissertation publication company, but the chance of anyone reading it is slim. If it occurs, it’s more than likely to be another student trying to find their gap in literature from your Future Recommendations for Research section in Chapter 5!

I know, I know – you spent years perfecting your dissertation. You hired editors and slaved away, missed family events and holidays. I felt the same way! The cold hard truth is that most dissertations are read by the Committee; maybe more folks at your College, but not much beyond that until you begin to publish in journals and only then if someone wants to refer to your original work. The small papers you publish from your dissertation are more likely to garner attention and contribute to the official academic body of knowledge than your doctoral study. This is one reason it’s so important to keep the problem statement narrow! Save the rest for your academic journal publications.

Your school may well offer to publish in their journal; sometimes this is more for their benefit than yours. If you are working in academics, generally speaking the more publications the merrier; go for it. Outside of that, you may want to focus on other ways to get your message out, like trade publications or the most sought after journals in your academic area. Even snippets of your outcomes posted over time on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/) can be beneficial.

## \#4: You Cannot Move Forward if You Do Not Hit the Required Sample Size.

Fact: You Can Move Forward Without the Desired Sample Size.

Your dissertation chairperson will want you to do everything possible to hit the required sample size, however you and your chair choose to accurately calculate that. There are different methods for each methodology. But – life happens, people don’t respond to surveys, pandemics hit, researchers run out of money and respondents check out.

Many of my students didn’t hit the sample size they needed, but they finished their work anyway and are now enjoying their status as a Doctor. How? They documented the limitation of the study. They noted that an assumption is they would receive X responses and they would achieve that by doing A, B, and C. They did all of those things and they documented along the way. But, the plan failed. So now, their study is restricted, or limited, to the sample size they did get. It likely means that the results are less generalizable to a larger population. It may even invalidate the results and the general outcome is A, B, C, but it is not a reliable outcome. Obviously that is less desirable, but it does not automatically mean you fail. I was reading a study the other day about hemicap toe implants, and the author attempted for a sample size of 20 but hit 4. He’s had over a million views and thousands of responses to his article. It happens to “famous” researchers, too. You do your absolute best to get the sample size without sacrificing quality respondents or responses, and then document what you did and did not achieve and how it affects the results of your study. When and how this criteria is met is up to your committee, but we can certainly [help you walk through this](https://dissertationprep.com/) and it is common.

## \#5: Your Dissertation Committee Will Agree About Your Work, Then You Charge Ahead.

Fact: Your Dissertation Committee is Compromised of Individuals with Different Perspectives.

If your committee agrees anything, consider yourself lucky! Part of your job as a doctoral candidate is navigating the opinions of multiple scholars. Yes I said opinions! But I thought this was supposed to be academic with cold, hard facts? Take scenario #4 above. What if your committee Chair thinks you did all you could and your response rate is “good enough” but your member(s) do not think so? This is your job to navigate. ( [Yes, we can help you!](https://dissertationprep.com/)) If your committee is in agreement on many things, consider yourself lucky. The student often feels stuck in the middle. You are! That’s part of your job as a researcher and it happens in real life, outside of the student realm. Get the team on the phone and find out what you can do to satisfy everyone. Get help if you need it to look at your work from another perspective.

Signing off for now,

## What Others Are Saying About Dissertation Prep:

### A Transformative Partner in My DBA Journey Providing Exceptional Guidance and Methodological Expertise

DissertationPrep.com provided me with exceptional guidance throughout my Doctor of Business Administration journey, offering the structure, encouragement, and expert support necessary to navigate the complexities of advanced scholarly research. Even with a strong academic foundation and confidence in navigating complex doctoral requirements, I quickly realized how invaluable it was to have DissertationPrep.com as a trusted partner throughout the process. In a remote, online doctoral environment, where communication with a Chair is bound by formal protocols and timely guidance is not always guaranteed (leading to enhanced levels of stress), their support provided clarity at moments when a single unresolved question could have delayed my progress. From the very first block of contracted time, the return on investment was unmistakable. Their expertise not only strengthened my research, but also reduced uncertainty, accelerated my momentum, and brought a sense of reassurance that made the entire journey far more manageable and fulfilling.
I am especially grateful for the support of Dr. Dhanraj, whose insightful coaching and deep command of research techniques and methodologies were instrumental to my progress and ultimate success. Without her coaching and personable approach, I would surely have foundered and succumbed to mental exhaustion. Her ability to clarify complex methodological decisions, strengthen my analytical approach, and ensure alignment with doctoral level standards allowed me to advance with confidence and precision during my journey. More importantly, her mentorship provided reassurance during the most demanding stages of the DBA process, reinforcing both academic rigor and practical relevance. I am sincerely appreciative of the services provided by DissertationPrep.com and Dr. Dhanraj for their meaningful role in helping me bring my research to completion and fulfilling my academic goal.

### Excellent Dissertation Support

I had the pleasure of working with Nicole Dhanraj on my doctoral dissertation. We worked together on developing a research proposal, which was immediately approved at my institution under her guidance and supervision. She has an excellent process in place to help facilitate the data collection process. She has even assisted me in the participant recruitment process, significantly reducing the time needed to graduate. I highly recommend Nicole to students conducting qualitative research. She wants her students to succeed, and she is definitely willing to go above and beyond her role as a qualitative methodologist. She has assisted me greatly in completing my doctorate.

### Help when I needed it!

My mentor Nicole D. was extremely helpful in giving me quality feedback on my qualitative dissertation, I wish I had reached out sooner for her help! Highly recommend.

### Recommendations for Nicole Dhanraj, PhD Coaching

"I started my dissertation study recruitment in January of 2023. Recruiting went smoothly for the first month. Then no matter what I tried, I was stuck halfway to completing the number of interviews I wanted for the study to demonstrate saturation. I found the disserationprep.com team when I asked for help in the Doctoral Moms Facebook group. I asked if there was any coaching for just the study recruitment process. Dani Babb, PhD, MBA responded and connected me to Nicole Dhanaj, PhD. The coaching process took 1 hour, broken into smaller pieces, but Nicole really went above and beyond. Not only coaching me on how to recruit, but also how to follow up on outreach. I was unsure and lacked confidence when I started. By the time we had completed the full hour of coaching, participants who met the study criteria were scheduled for interviews. Nicole is supportive, encouraging, and a great coach, who taught me an important skill for my own development that I will use in future projects. If you are unsure if someone will be able to help with any step of the dissertation process, reach out to the dissertationprep.com team. It was well-worth the time and financial investment. My thanks and appreciation to Nicole for all she did for me!"

## Page 51: About the Founder – DissertationPrep
URL: https://dissertationprep.com/pages/about-us
Description: I am Dr. Dani Babb, and I founded Dissertation Prep after nearly two decades as a dissertation chair and doctoral mentor. Since 2004, I’ve worked with students at multiple universities and have seen firsthand how easily even strong learners can become stuck—sometimes for months or years—while tuition keeps adding up. M

## About Us

Even the most capable doctoral students can get stuck. Despite universities’ best efforts to provide strong support and resources, many learners still face challenges completing their dissertations. At Dissertation Prep, we’ve seen this happen time and again—bright students stalling at ABD (All But Dissertation) because they’re missing the personalized guidance, clarity, and momentum they need to cross the finish line.

With over 170 years of experience, our hand-selected team of experienced dissertation chairs, editors, and mentors understands why students struggle—confusion about structure or statistics, unclear feedback, writing challenges, or simply feeling overwhelmed. We meet students where they are, offering customized coaching, editing, and support designed to move them forward efficiently and confidently..

## Vision

We believe education is both transformative and essential—not just for personal growth, but for a stronger, more informed society. The doctoral degree represents the pinnacle of academic achievement, and no student should face endless frustration trying to reach it. Our vision is a world where every committed doctoral learner has access to the one-on-one mentorship needed to graduate and succeed..

## Mission

Our mission is to help doctoral students graduate faster and with greater confidence. We provide expert editing, coaching, and feedback that encourage a structured, disciplined approach to the dissertation process. Beyond helping students finish, we aim to teach lifelong research, writing, and problem-solving skills—empowering every learner to become a stronger scholar and professional.

# About the Founder

I am Dr. Dani Babb, and I founded Dissertation Prep after nearly two decades as a dissertation chair and doctoral mentor. Since 2004, I’ve worked with students at multiple universities and have seen firsthand how easily even strong learners can become stuck—sometimes for months or years—while tuition keeps adding up.

Most universities provide excellent group resources, writing centers, and workshops, but many students still need personalized one-on-one guidance. Common roadblocks include planning, understanding feedback, data analysis, methodology, and academic writing. My goal was to build a team of experienced dissertation chairs, editors, and faculty mentors who could fill that gap.

Together, we’ve built Dissertation Prep into a trusted resource where students can find real-time support, weekly coaching, professional editing, and the expertise to move from overwhelmed to accomplished. Every member of our team has mentored countless doctoral candidates, and we share one theme: to help you graduate.

Let’s move you from where you are—to where you want to be. Because the Goal is Graduation.

I have happily served on over 200 doctoral dissertation committees as chair, co-chair, or member. My students refer to me as a user-friendly source of help with the traditionally “tough stuff” of research, statistics, qualitative analysis, and mixed methods. I have also served on the IRB of two schools as member. I have developed and taught online courses research design, statistics, and qualitative methods. Additionally, I like to publish and make presentations in various aspects of online teaching and learning. I live in the beautiful North Country of Flagstaff, Arizona.

# Providing The Best Support For Doctoral Students

Colleges want to provide the best support they can for doctoral students. Given budgetary constraints and the need to create solutions that meet most students where they are at, unfortunately some students do get left behind and struggle more than others to complete their doctoral degree. I have seen this happen since I began mentoring in 2004

Dissertation Prep serves as a solid bridge between the student and the institution to help move them from candidate to completion with less stress and more one-on-one coaching, using feedback from the students own Dissertation committee as the cornerstone of our work. If you have a group of learners you feel would benefit from added guidance, help staying on track, assistance running statistical analysis, putting together their proposals or final Dissertations, we would be happy to provide this for your students and can provide institutional pricing. Moving students through will improve your graduation numbers and do right by learners who need extra guidance to get from ABD to Doctor!

## About Us

Even the most capable doctoral students can get stuck. Despite universities’ best efforts to provide strong support and resources, many learners still face challenges completing their dissertations. At Dissertation Prep, we’ve seen this happen time and again—bright students stalling at ABD (All But Dissertation) because they’re missing the personalized guidance, clarity, and momentum they need to cross the finish line.

With over 170 years of experience, our hand-selected team of experienced dissertation chairs, editors, and mentors understands why students struggle—confusion about structure or statistics, unclear feedback, writing challenges, or simply feeling overwhelmed. We meet students where they are, offering customized coaching, editing, and support designed to move them forward efficiently and confidently..

## Vision

We believe education is both transformative and essential—not just for personal growth, but for a stronger, more informed society. The doctoral degree represents the pinnacle of academic achievement, and no student should face endless frustration trying to reach it. Our vision is a world where every committed doctoral learner has access to the one-on-one mentorship needed to graduate and succeed..

## Mission

Our mission is to help doctoral students graduate faster and with greater confidence. We provide expert editing, coaching, and feedback that encourage a structured, disciplined approach to the dissertation process. Beyond helping students finish, we aim to teach lifelong research, writing, and problem-solving skills—empowering every learner to become a stronger scholar and professional.

## DNP Academy for Doctorate in Nursing Practice Students

[DNP Academy](https://dnpacademy.com/) is here to support students through the development and evaluation of evidence-based practice quality improvement projects that are scholarly and rigorous. Quality improvement is not research, therefore there must be a definable gap in practice with data to support the problem. At that point, an intervention can be found that is based on research and supported in the literature.

The DNP project is a learning experience; an opportunity to apply skills learned in your courses in a real-world context (American Association of Colleges of Nursing \[AACN\], 2006; AACN, 2013). The goal of the DNP project is to equip graduates with high-level problem-solving skills that they can use beyond graduation.

All consultants at DNP Academy have extensive experience with all aspects of evidence-based quality improvement projects in both the academic and healthcare settings. Jointly, we have supported more than 1000 students in their doctoral journey. Spending more than a decade in higher education we saw that students need coaching and support that isn’t typically available at their university or college. While there are many resources for doctoral students who are in their dissertation phase, there is not a similar resource for the DNP student. Hence DNP Academy was born.

A. **Enrollment and Coaching**

i. Availability and eligibility are at the absolute and sole discretion of the Company.

ii. Your enrollment in our Services is subject to approval at the absolute and sole discretion of the Company based on factors including but not limited to availability of our staff, your area of study, and your status in your doctoral program.

iii. Our satisfaction guarantee applies to plans of 4 weeks or longer. For these plans only, after the date of your first call with your coach, you have 7 days to withdraw and receive a full refund of the amount paid excluding editing services which are not refundable under any circumstances. After this period for qualifying plans or for all other plans that do not qualify for the satisfaction guarantee, you agree that the full tuition is owed to and has been earned by Company at the time of your enrollment, and you agree no refund of tuition paid or waiver of tuition owed will be provided to you under any circumstances. Moreover, Services must begin within 30 days of enrollment unless explicitly approved in advance by Company.

iv. You agree that the Services begin on the start date and end on the end date as stated in your enrollment email.

v. If extreme unexpected circumstances arise which impair your ability to work with your coach, you may request one pause in advance via notification to your coach and our support team through our [Contact Us page](https://dissertationprep.com/pages/contact-us). However, you agree that any such pause and/or extension of the end date is solely at the Company’s discretion and that this does not in any way affect or invalidate any of the Terms of Service.

vi. You agree that you will authorize and make all payments for the full tuition amount and that the automatic payments (if applicable) will not be canceled. You agree that failure to pay the tuition in full will result in legal action and/or reporting your account to a collections agency.

vii. Deposits toward a future enrollment are valid for six months from the date of payment.

viii. An appointment scheduled with a coach must be cancelled at least 24 hours prior to the scheduled time. If not, then the appointment is counted against the allotment for the package in which you enrolled, if applicable.

B. **Confidentiality**

i. Each Party may disclose to the other Party information that it deems as confidential (hereinafter “Confidential Information”) which may include but is not limited to research, invention descriptions, technical and business information related to proprietary ideas, trade secrets, and current or future business plans or ideas.

ii. The receiving Party shall neither disclose to any third party nor use the Confidential Information it receives from the originating Party for any purpose other than that contemplated hereunder for so long as Confidential Information must be maintained in confidence unless the originating Party shall agree otherwise in writing. Each Party agrees to take reasonable and appropriate measures to keep confidential and to safeguard from theft or loss and to limit access to Confidential Information to those authorized agents within the receiving Party’s organization that reasonably require access to the Confidential Information for carrying out the purpose herein and who have agreed to protect the Confidential Information in accordance with the terms herein.

iii. Confidential Information shall not be considered confidential or subject to terms herein, if the receiving Party can establish that the same: (a) was rightfully in the possession of the receiving Party prior to the date of disclosure of such Confidential Information as evidenced by competent proof; or (b) is or becomes a part of the public knowledge or literature without breach of the terms herein by the receiving Party; or (c) is supplied without restriction on disclosure to the receiving Party by a third party who had a lawful right to disclose it and is under no obligation to the originating Party to maintain such Confidential Information in confidence; or (d) is developed by the receiving Party independently of the disclosure made under the terms herein as demonstrated by competent proof. Confidential Information shall not be deemed to be available to the public or in the possession of the receiving Party merely because it is embraced by more general information so available or in the receiving Party’s possession.

iv. Should the receiving Party be faced with judicial or governmental action to disclose Confidential Information received hereunder, said Party shall take reasonable steps to notify the originating Party in advance of such disclosure. Should the receiving Party become aware of any breach of the provisions herein related to Confidential Information, the receiving Party agrees to promptly notify the originating Party thereof in writing, and the originating Party shall have the right to immediately terminate the relationship between the Parties. Confidential Information shall remain the property of the originating Party. Nothing herein shall be construed as granting any right or license to any invention, patent, or other property now or hereafter owned or controlled by either Party.

8\. **Modifications and Validity**

Company may revise these Terms of Service at any time without notice. By using our Website and Services, you are agreeing to be bound by the then current version of these Terms of Service. These Terms of Service constitute the entire understanding of the Parties related to the Services. No variation, modification, or waiver of these Terms of Service shall be deemed valid unless in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both Parties. If any provision herein is to any extent illegal, otherwise invalid, or unenforceable, such provision shall be excluded to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability; all other provisions herein shall remain in full force and effect; and, to the extent permitted and possible, the invalid or unenforceable provision shall be deemed replaced by a provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of such invalid or unenforceable provision. Failure to enforce any of the terms or conditions herein shall not constitute a waiver of any such terms or conditions, or of any other terms or conditions.

9\. **Governing Law**

These terms and conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of California, and you irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that state or location.

## About Us

Even the most capable doctoral students can get stuck. Despite universities’ best efforts to provide strong support and resources, many learners still face challenges completing their dissertations. At Dissertation Prep, we’ve seen this happen time and again—bright students stalling at ABD (All But Dissertation) because they’re missing the personalized guidance, clarity, and momentum they need to cross the finish line.

With over 170 years of experience, our hand-selected team of experienced dissertation chairs, editors, and mentors understands why students struggle—confusion about structure or statistics, unclear feedback, writing challenges, or simply feeling overwhelmed. We meet students where they are, offering customized coaching, editing, and support designed to move them forward efficiently and confidently..

## Vision

We believe education is both transformative and essential—not just for personal growth, but for a stronger, more informed society. The doctoral degree represents the pinnacle of academic achievement, and no student should face endless frustration trying to reach it. Our vision is a world where every committed doctoral learner has access to the one-on-one mentorship needed to graduate and succeed..

## Mission

Our mission is to help doctoral students graduate faster and with greater confidence. We provide expert editing, coaching, and feedback that encourage a structured, disciplined approach to the dissertation process. Beyond helping students finish, we aim to teach lifelong research, writing, and problem-solving skills—empowering every learner to become a stronger scholar and professional.

[DNP Academy](https://dnpacademy.com/) is here to support students through the development and evaluation of evidence-based practice quality improvement projects that are scholarly and rigorous. Quality improvement is not research, therefore there must be a definable gap in practice with data to support the problem. At that point, an intervention can be found that is based on research and supported in the literature.

## Page 89: Important FAQs | Dissertation Prep – DissertationPrep
URL: https://dissertationprep.com/pages/important-faqs
Description: The dissertation proposal is a comprehensive statement on the extent and nature of the student’s dissertation research interests. Through our years of experience, we have found that the proposal is the #1 obstacle doctoral students face when writing their dissertation.

## Important FAQs

## Collapsible content

### What Is The Dissertation Proposal?

The Dissertation proposal is a comprehensive statement on the extent and nature of the student’s Dissertation research interests.

The major components of the proposal are as follows, with some variations across Areas and disciplines:

1. A detailed statement of the problem that is to be studied and the context within which it is to be seen. This should include a justification of the importance of the problem on both theoretical and educational grounds.

2. A thorough review of the literature pertinent to the research problem. This review should provide proof that the relevant literature in the field has been thoroughly researched. Good research is cumulative; it builds on the thoughts, findings, and mistakes of others.

3. A statement on the overall methodological design of the proposed study, which includes:
1. its general explanatory interest
2. the overall theoretical framework within which this interest is to be pursued
3. the model or hypotheses to be tested or the research questions to be answered
4. a discussion of the conceptual and operational properties of the variables
5. an overview of strategies for collecting appropriate evidence (sampling, instrumentation, data collection, data reduction, data analysis)
6. a discussion of how the evidence is to be interpreted (This aspect of the proposal will be somewhat different in fields such as history and philosophy of education.)

### What Are The Details Of The Program?

Our 12 week **Velocity Proposal Program** or our 12 week **Final Dissertation Velocity Program** are designed to demystify the Dissertation process and help you mentally unblock so that you can write your proposal or final Dissertation more quickly, defend it with clarity and confidence, and move into the next phase of post-academic work.

In order to accomplish this, we will focus on 3 key steps:

**Step 1: Determine Where You Are:** In Step One, you determine where you are and where you need to be with your coach, share your feedback thus far and with your Coach, develop a path to achieve your goals. Additionally, you will develop your proposal completion plan. This process includes developing incentives for yourself for each milestone you complete.

**Step 2: Write Your Proposal:** Step Two is all about understanding how to write the various chapters of your proposal. We will cover how to write your introduction, problem statement, purpose statement, literature review, theoretical framework, and methodology. We will also explore how to navigate the institutional review board process so your study is approved quickly!

**Step 3: Data Collection** In Step Three you are working toward collecting data post-IRB approval and analyzing your data, and preparing Chapters 4 and 5. You will not only know how to conduct your defense with confidence, you will be prepared for the question and answer position of the defense call!

### Does It Matter What Stage Of My Proposal I Am In, And How Do I Allocate The 12 Weeks?

The stage you are in doesn’t matter,

If you feel stuck, discouraged, or unsure about how to move forward, this program is for you.

If you are confident in your work and looking for a big push to get to the next phase, this program is for you.

No matter what stage you are in, this program can help propel your work to the next level and help better position you for success.

We meet you exactly where you are at, and design a plan from that point. Our singular goal is to help you reach your next milestone. This may or may not happen in 12 weeks, as there are many outside factors that are out of our control and often out of your control as well. Some students may finish early and we can use the extra time to work on the next steps, and some students may need more time and select to sign up for post-program extended support or the Final Dissertation Velocity Program.

### What Makes This Program So Special?

We are not in the information selling business, or into selling courses with just more information.

Most students who come to us have purchased courses, read books, signed up for webinars, and still are in the same spot. That’s the “info” industry.

What our students need is hand-holding, and dedicated, timely, and compassionate support that they do not get from their chair or school.

Our difference?

We focus on results and outcomes.

Our success means that you get your work accepted.

Our only goal is to help you accomplish this major lifetime achievement.

### Who Will Be Your Coach?

You will get to choose and be assigned to one coach who will work with you from start to finish. We maintain a small, dedicated, team of professors, Dissertation chairs, methodologists, executive coaches, and curriculum developers, who know the world of academia and how to successfully complete a doctoral Dissertation.

### What Areas Will I Be Coached In During The Program?

During our 12 week programs, we will coach you through any of the following areas (meeting you where you are at):

How to summarize the contents of your thesis to complete the introduction
How to describe the background of the problem
How to ensure alignment between the components of your work
How to summarize the theoretical foundations and review of the literature
How to identify the problem statement
How to identify the purpose of your study
How to describe the research questions
How to identify the significance of your study
How to describe the research methodology
How to complete the research design
How to describe the instrumentation
How to describe the data collection procedures
How to describe data analysis procedures
How to describe the ethical considerations
How to apply for and obtain IRB approval
How to reach a sample size needed to conclude your research
How to write up your analysis of data
How to analyze and interpret data
How to conclude your work
How to defend your work
And more...

The most important part of our success with you is that you will provide us with all university templates, documents, and guidelines provided by your school so that we can customize our approach to your university's specific requirements!

### Who Is This Program For?

This program is not for everyone, but if any of these apply to you, then you would be a good fit for one of our programs:

- You’ve been working on your Dissertation for months (maybe even years), but you still have not managed to gain committee consensus.
- You know you need to finish your Dissertation, but you keep telling yourself “I’ll get back to writing later”...and you never do.
- You know that earning your doctorate is the first step to securing your career and financial future, but the thought of writing a 100-plus page Dissertation to make it happen keeps you stressed and overwhelmed.
- You have seen success in your current and past positions, but your goal is to secure advancement, a new position, or increase your financial income, and you know that can’t happen without completing your Dissertation.
- You are ready to use your Dissertation to impact people, communities, and organizations that you care about, but it feels like that may never happen since your Dissertation chair won’t approve your work.

### Who Is It Not For?

Our coaches understand the challenges of the Dissertation journey and will guide and encourage you just like the hundreds before you. However, we do not write your Dissertation for you, nor will we perform the statistical analysis on your data. If you are seeking someone to do the work for you, then our program is not the right fit.

### How Much Does The VPP Or DVP Program Cost?

**Your Fee for the entire 12 weeks including everything above: $4,500 to be paid before the start of the program.**

### What Guarantee Do You Offer?

If this doesn’t work for you, it doesn’t work for us.

We don’t think that you will be unhappy, but if it isn’t for you, you’ll definitely know during the first week.

By the end of the first 7 days of your program, if you have decided that this program is not for you, then you can cancel your enrollment with a full refund excluding editing services which are not refundable under any circumstances.

YES - we will refund you back 100% of what you paid because if you find that this isn’t for you, then neither you nor our company will be successful by trying to create a fit where there is not one.

You have absolutely no risk with this 7 day guarantee.

After 7 days, we presume you will be committed and decided this program is for you and no refunds will be offered. But don’t worry, we’ll double check with you on Day 7 to make sure everything is good to go.

### What Happens After The 12 Weeks Of Coaching?

You’ll have the option to extend the program for 4 weeks, 8 weeks, or 12 weeks! Your rate will be less than the original program.
